abstract = {This paper proposes novel skin lesion detection based on neutrosophic clustering and adaptive region growing algorithms applied to dermoscopic images, called NCARG. First, the dermoscopic images are mapped into a neutrosophic set domain using the shearlet transform results for the images. The images are described via three memberships: true, indeterminate, and false memberships. An indeterminate filter is then defined in the neutrosophic set for reducing the indeterminacy of the images. A neutrosophic c-means clustering algorithm is applied to segment the dermoscopic images. With the clustering results, skin lesions are identified precisely using an adaptive region growing method. To evaluate the performance of this algorithm, a public data set (ISIC 2017) is employed to train and test the proposed method. Fifty images are randomly selected for training and 500 images for testing. Several metrics are measured for quantitatively evaluating the performance of NCARG. The results establish that the proposed approach has the ability to detect a lesion with high accuracy, 95.3{\%} average value, compared to the obtained average accuracy, 80.6{\%}, found when employing the neutrosophic similarity score and level set (NSSLS) segmentation approach.},

abstract = {Melanoma is a curable aggressive skin cancer if detected early. Typically, the diagnosis involves initial screening with subsequent biopsy and histopathological examination if necessary. Computer aided diagnosis offers an objective score that is independent of clinical experience and the potential to lower the workload of a dermatologist. In the recent past, success of deep learning algorithms in the field of general computer vision has motivated successful application of supervised deep learning methods in computer aided melanoma recognition. However, large quantities of labeled images are required to make further improvements on the supervised method. A good annotation generally requires clinical and histological confirmation, which requires significant effort. In an attempt to alleviate this constraint, we propose to use categorical generative adversarial network to automatically learn the feature representation of dermoscopy images in an unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Thorough experiments on ISIC 2016 skin lesion chal- lenge demonstrate that the proposed feature learning method has achieved an average precision score of 0.424 with only 140 labeled images. Moreover, the proposed method is also capable of generating real-world like dermoscopy images.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach that combines conventional image processing with deep learning by fusing the features from the individual techniques. We hypothesize that the two techniques, with different error profiles, are synergistic. The conventional image processing arm uses three handcrafted biologically inspired image processing modules and one clinical information module. The image processing modules detect lesion features comparable to clinical dermoscopy information - atypical pigment network, color distribution, and blood vessels. The clinical module includes information submitted to the pathologist - patient age, gender, lesion location, size, and patient history. The deep learning arm utilizes knowledge transfer via a ResNet-50 network that is repurposed to predict the probability of melanoma classification. The classification scores of each individual module from both processing arms are then ensembled utilizing logistic regression to predict an overall melanoma probability. Using cross-validated results of melanoma classification measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), classification accuracy of 0.94 was obtained for the fusion technique. In comparison, the ResNet-50 deep learning based classifier alone yields an AUC of 0.87 and conventional image processing based classifier yields an AUC of 0.90. Further study of fusion of conventional image processing techniques and deep learning is warranted.},

abstract = {Nonlinear methods such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the gold standard for various challenging machine learning problems such as image recognition. Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.},

abstract = {This letter reports on WaterGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating realistic underwater images from in-air image and depth pairings in an unsupervised pipeline used for color correction of monocular underwater images. Cameras onboard autonomous and remotely operated vehicles can capture high-resolution images to map the seafloor; however, underwater image formation is subject to the complex process of light propagation through the water column. The raw images retrieved are characteristically different than images taken in air due to effects, such as absorption and scattering, which cause attenuation of light at different rates for different wavelengths. While this physical process is well described theoretically, the model depends on many parameters intrinsic to the water column as well as the structure of the scene. These factors make recovery of these parameters difficult without simplifying assumptions or field calibration; hence, restoration of underwater images is a nontrivial problem. Deep learning has demonstrated great success in modeling complex nonlinear systems but requires a large amount of training data, which is difficult to compile in deep sea environments. Using WaterGAN, we generate a large training dataset of corresponding depth, in-air color images, and realistic underwater images. These data serve as input to a two-stage network for color correction of monocular underwater images. Our proposed pipeline is validated with testing on real data collected from both a pure water test tank and from underwater surveys collected in the field.

abstract = {RATIONALE: Malignant melanoma (MM) is the cutaneous neoplasia with the greatest mortality rates and one of the malignancies with the highest potential of dissemination. The prognosis of patients with metastatic MM is grim, with a 5-years survival rate between 5-19{\%}, and is dictated by the location and the number of metastases.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the survival of patients with metastatic MM from our study and find out if the metastasis' location influences survival.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2013, 155 patients with cutaneous MM were diagnosed in our clinic. All the patients were staged according to 2009 AJCC staging system. The median follow-up period was of 24 months. Survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method with a confidence level of 95{\%}. 40.5{\%} of the patients developed metastases in different organs, especially the brain. 80.6{\%} of those with metastases died during the study. The median overall survival, estimated for the entire group of patients who developed metastases, was of 5.3 months.
DISCUSSION: The influence of metastases distribution on the overall survival was examined and it was noticed that there were statistically significant differences between the risks of death of various groups of patients, depending on metastasis topography. Thus, the death probability of a patient with brain metastases is twice that of a patient with digestive metastasis, about 7 times higher than that of a patient with lung metastasis (p=0.0004) and 12 times higher than the death risk of a patient with extra-regional lymph nodes or subcutaneous metastasis (p=0.0000).},

We designed the first semi-automated legs scanner which uses one camera and laser range finder to capture images and measurements respectively. The scanner circulates around the leg, along its full length. From the collected data, a 3D leg model with moles is created. The moles are registered over temporal scans for comparison and detection of moles' evolution. Our algorithm was tested on simulated leg model that changes over time. The average accuracy of mole registration from two temporal scans at optimal scanner settings was 94.87{\%} with standard deviation of 6.10.},

@article{FerrantediRuffano2018,
abstract = {Background: Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and to improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are high-risk skin cancers which have the potential to metastasise and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localised with potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety around missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems use artificial intelligence to analyse lesion data and arrive at a diagnosis of skin cancer. When used in unreferred settings ('primary care'), CAD may assist general practitioners (GPs) or other clinicians to more appropriately triage high-risk lesions to secondary care. Used alongside clinical and dermoscopic suspicion of malignancy, CAD may reduce unnecessary excisions without missing melanoma cases. Objectives: To determine the accuracy of CAD systems for diagnosing cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants, BCC or cSCC in adults, and to compare its accuracy with that of dermoscopy. Search methods: We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; CPCI; Zetoc; Science Citation Index; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We studied reference lists and published systematic review articles. Selection criteria: Studies of any design that evaluated CAD alone, or in comparison with dermoscopy, in adults with lesions suspicious for melanoma or BCC or cSCC, and compared with a reference standard of either histological confirmation or clinical follow-up. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted all data using a standardised data extraction and quality assessment form (based on QUADAS-2). We contacted authors of included studies where information related to the target condition or diagnostic threshold were missing. We estimated summary sensitivities and specificities separately by type of CAD system, using the bivariate hierarchical model. We compared CAD with dermoscopy using (a) all available CAD data (indirect comparisons), and (b) studies providing paired data for both tests (direct comparisons). We tested the contribution of human decision-making to the accuracy of CAD diagnoses in a sensitivity analysis by removing studies that gave CAD results to clinicians to guide diagnostic decision-making. Main results: We included 42 studies, 24 evaluating digital dermoscopy-based CAD systems (Derm-CAD) in 23 study cohorts with 9602 lesions (1220 melanomas, at least 83 BCCs, 9 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Derm-CAD and seven for dermoscopy. Eighteen studies evaluated spectroscopy-based CAD (Spectro-CAD) in 16 study cohorts with 6336 lesions (934 melanomas, 163 BCC, 49 cSCCs), providing 32 datasets for Spectro-CAD and six for dermoscopy. These consisted of 15 studies using multispectral imaging (MSI), two studies using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and one study using diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy. Studies were incompletely reported and at unclear to high risk of bias across all domains. Included studies inadequately address the review question, due to an abundance of low-quality studies, poor reporting, and recruitment of highly selected groups of participants. Across all CAD systems, we found considerable variation in the hardware and software technologies used, the types of classification algorithm employed, methods used to train the algorithms, and which lesion morphological features were extracted and analysed across all CAD systems, and even between studies evaluating CAD systems. Meta-analysis found CAD systems had high sensitivity for correct identification of cutaneous invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants in highly selected populations, but with low and very variable specificity, particularly for Spectro-CAD systems. Pooled data from 22 studies estimated the sensitivity of Derm-CAD for the detection of melanoma as 90.1{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 84.0{\%} to 94.0{\%}) and specificity as 74.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 63.6{\%} to 82.7{\%}). Pooled data from eight studies estimated the sensitivity of multispectral imaging CAD (MSI-CAD) as 92.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 83.7{\%} to 97.1{\%}) and specificity as 43.6{\%} (95{\%} CI 24.8{\%} to 64.5{\%}). When applied to a hypothetical population of 1000 lesions at the mean observed melanoma prevalence of 20{\%}, Derm-CAD would miss 20 melanomas and would lead to 206 false-positive results for melanoma. MSI-CAD would miss 14 melanomas and would lead to 451 false diagnoses for melanoma. Preliminary findings suggest CAD systems are at least as sensitive as assessment of dermoscopic images for the diagnosis of invasive melanoma and atypical intraepidermal melanocytic variants. We are unable to make summary statements about the use of CAD in unreferred populations, or its accuracy in detecting keratinocyte cancers, or its use in any setting as a diagnostic aid, because of the paucity of studies. Authors' conclusions: In highly selected patient populations all CAD types demonstrate high sensitivity, and could prove useful as a back-up for specialist diagnosis to assist in minimising the risk of missing melanomas. However, the evidence base is currently too poor to understand whether CAD system outputs translate to different clinical decision-making in practice. Insufficient data are available on the use of CAD in community settings, or for the detection of keratinocyte cancers. The evidence base for individual systems is too limited to draw conclusions on which might be preferred for practice. Prospective comparative studies are required that evaluate the use of already evaluated CAD systems as diagnostic aids, by comparison to face-to-face dermoscopy, and in participant populations that are representative of those in which the test would be used in practice.},

abstract = {In order for machine learning to be trusted in many applications, it is critical to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions. For this reason, a variety of methods have been developed recently to interpret neural network predictions by providing, for example, feature importance maps. For both scientific robustness and security reasons, it is important to know to what extent can the interpretations be altered by small systematic perturbations to the input data, which might be generated by adversaries or by measurement biases. In this paper, we demonstrate how to generate adversarial perturbations that produce perceptively indistinguishable inputs that are assigned the same predicted label, yet have very different interpretations. We systematically characterize the robustness of interpretations generated by several widely-used feature importance interpretation methods (feature importance maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. In all cases, our experiments show that systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly susceptible to adversarial attack. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why robustness is a general challenge to current interpretation approaches.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Melanomas that clinically mimic seborrheic keratosis (SK) can delay diagnosis and adequate treatment. However, little is known about the value of dermoscopy in recognizing these difficult-to-diagnose melanomas. OBJECTIVE: To describe the dermoscopic features of SK-like melanomas to understand their clinical morphology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational retrospective study used 134 clinical and dermoscopic images of histopathologically proven melanomas in 134 patients treated in 9 skin cancer centers in Spain, France, Italy, and Austria. Without knowledge that the definite diagnosis for all the lesions was melanoma, 2 dermoscopy-trained observers evaluated the clinical descriptions and 48 dermoscopic features (including all melanocytic and nonmelanocytic criteria) of all 134 images and classified each dermoscopically as SK or not SK. The total dermoscopy score and the 7-point checklist score were assessed. Images of the lesions and patient data were collected from July 15, 2013, through July 31, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequencies of specific morphologic patterns of (clinically and dermoscopically) SK-like melanomas, patient demographics, and interobserver agreement of criteria were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 134 cases collected from 72 men and 61 women, all of whom were white and who had a mean (SD) age of 55.6 (17.5) years, 110 (82.1{\%}) revealed dermoscopic features suggestive of melanoma, including pigment network (74 [55.2{\%}]), blue-white veil (72 [53.7{\%}]), globules and dots (68 [50.7{\%}]), pseudopods or streaks (47 [35.1{\%}]), and blue-black sign (43 [32.3{\%}]). The remaining 24 cases (17.9{\%}) were considered likely SKs, even by dermoscopy. Overall, lesions showed a scaly and hyperkeratotic surface (45 [33.6{\%}]), yellowish keratin (42 [31.3{\%}]), comedo-like openings (41 [30.5{\%}]), and milia-like cysts (30 [22.4{\%}]). The entire sample achieved a mean (SD) total dermoscopy score of 4.7 (1.6) and a 7-point checklist score of 4.4 (2.3), while dermoscopically SK-like melanomas achieved a total dermoscopy score of only 4.2 (1.3) and a 7-point checklist score of 2.0 (1.9), both in the range of benignity. The most helpful criteria in correctly diagnosing SK-like melanomas were the presence of blue-white veil, pseudopods or streaks, and pigment network. Multivariate analysis found only the blue-black sign to be significantly associated with a correct diagnosis, while hyperkeratosis and fissures and ridges were independent risk markers of dermoscopically SK-like melanomas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Seborrheic keratosis-like melanomas can be dermoscopically challenging, but the presence of the blue-black sign, pigment network, pseudopods or streaks, and/or blue-white veil, despite the presence of other SK features, allows the correct diagnosis of most of the difficult melanoma cases.},

abstract = {Diagnostic accuracy for melanoma was determined in a dedicated pigmented lesion clinic. We assessed the impact of duration of experience in dermatology and also the relationship between tumour thickness and accuracy of clinical diagnosis. We reviewed the histopathology request forms and reports for all biopsies generated by the Pigmented Lesion Clinic, Western Infirmary, Glasgow during 1992-94 inclusive. The clinic is staffed by two consultants, one senior registrar and one registrar. Diagnostic accuracy, index of suspicion, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated for the clinic overall, and for each grade of staff. One hundred and sixty-three lesions were diagnosed clinically as melanoma. A histopathological diagnosis of melanoma was made for 128 lesions during this period, 113 of which had been correctly diagnosed before surgery. The diagnostic accuracy for two dermatologists each with {\textgreater} 10 years experience in dermatology was 80{\%}, with sensitivity of 91{\%} and positive predictive value of 86{\%}. Diagnostic accuracy rates for two senior registrars (each with 3-5 years experience) and six registrars (each with 1-2 years experience) were 62{\%} and 56{\%}, respectively. Thin and intermediate thickness melanomas generated the greatest inaccuracy irrespective of clinical experience, although registrars failed to recognize melanoma three times more often than the other groups. We report the diagnostic accuracy for melanoma by trained dermatologists to be higher than previously reported. In comparison with trainees, {\textgreater} 10 years experience in dermatology and exposure to more than 10 melanomas per year appears to be associated with greater diagnostic accuracy. Knowledge of the current clinical diagnostic accuracy at varying levels of experience is essential if the impact of training is to be evaluated. As pigmented lesions of virtually all types can be treated within dermatology departments, dermatologists are the appropriate first point of referral for suspected early melanoma.},

abstract = {Introduction: Location of malignant melanoma lesions depends on environmental, genetic, sociological and demographical factors. Available sources do not provide enough information on such dependencies in various populations. There is no data concerning the role of socio-demographic factors for the population of the Central and Eastern Europe. Aim: The aim of this work was to evaluate the anatomical location of the primary malignant melanoma lesion in correlation to patients' gender and age. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of medical documentation of 363 patients has been performed. The patients had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma and were undergoing treatment in the years 2010-2014 in two Polish oncologic hospitals. The subject group consisted of 199 (55{\%}) females and 164 (45{\%}) males. The age varied between 19 - 90 years, with the median of 62 years. Results: In women, the melanoma lesions seem to appear more often in their lower extremities, while in case of men such lesions seem to be more often on their torsos. In both cases, the difference was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01 When the specific locations are considered in women the lesions were more often located on their shins (p {\textless} 0.01), whereas for men the lesions were located on their backs (p {\textless} 0.01). It has been observed that there is dependency between lesion localization and age of patients. The lesions located on heads and necks were most common in older patients, and the lesions located in lower extremities were most common in younger ones. Conclusion: Differences in location of malignant melanoma lesions may be due to either genetic or environmental reasons. It is often emphasized in literature that correlation between the socio-demographic factors and the process of oncogenesis requires intensive research. In our work, we have tried to fill this gap for the population of Central and Eastern Europe to determine the exact epidemiology of this kind of cancer. This knowledge may be then used for developing cancer prevention methods specific to gender and age.},

This framework augments training data to include explanations elicited from domain users, in addition to features and labels. This approach ensures that explanations for predictions are tailored to the complexity expectations and domain knowledge of the consumer. In this paper, we build on this foundational work, by exploring more sophisticated instantiations of the TED framework and empirically evaluate their effectiveness in two diverse domains, chemical odor and skin cancer prediction.

We propose to learn a decision tree, which clarifies the specific reason for each prediction made by the CNN at the semantic level. I.e., the decision tree decomposes feature representations in high conv-layers of the CNN into elementary concepts of object parts. In this way, the decision tree tells people which object parts activate which filters for the prediction and how much each object part contributes to the prediction score. Such semantic and quantitative explanations for CNN predictions have specific values beyond the traditional pixel-level analysis of CNNs. More specifically, our method mines all potential decision modes of the CNN, where each mode represents a typical case of how the CNN uses object parts for prediction. The decision tree organizes all potential decision modes in a coarse-to-fine manner to explain CNN predictions at different fine-grained levels. Experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Background: The difficulties in accurately assessing pigmented skin lesions are ever present in practice. The recently described ABCD rule of dermatoscopy (skin surface microscopy at ×10 magnification), based on the criteria asymmetry (A), border (B), color (C), and differential structure (D), improved diagnostic accuracy when applied retrospectively to clinical slides. Objective: A study was designed to evaluate the prospective value of the ABCD rule of dermatoscopy in melanocytic lesions. Methods: In 172 melanocytic pigmented skin lesions, the criteria of the ABCD rule of dermatoscopy were analyzed with a semiquantitative scoring system before excision. Results: According to the retrospectively determined threshold, tumors with a score higher than 5.45 (64/69 melanomas [92.8{\%}]) were classified as malignant, whereas lesions with a lower score were considered as benign (93/103 melanocytic nevi [90.3{\%}]). Negative predictive value for melanoma (True-Negative ÷ [True-Negative + False-Negative]) was 9 5.8{\%}, whereas positive predictive value (True-Positive ÷ [True-Positive + False-Positive]) was 85.3{\%}. Diagnostic accuracy for melanoma (True-Positive ÷ [True-Positive + False- Positive + False-Negative]) was 80.0{\%}, compared with 64.4{\%} by the naked eye. Melanoma showed a mean final dermatoscopy score of 6.79 (SD, ± 0.92), significantly differing from melanocytic nevi (mean score, 4.27 ± 0.99; p {\textless}0.01, U test). Conclusion: The ABCD rule can be easily learned and rapidly calculated, and has proven to be reliable. It should be routinely applied to all equivocal pigmented skin lesions to reach a more objective and reproducible diagnosis and to obtain this assessment preoperatively. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Academy of Dermatology, Inc..

We propose DermGAN, an adaptation of the popular Pix2Pix architecture, to create synthetic images for a pre-specified skin condition while being able to vary its size, location and the underlying skin color. We demonstrate that the generated images are of high fidelity using objective GAN evaluation metrics. In a Human Turing test, we note that the synthetic images are not only visually similar to real images, but also embody the respective skin condition in dermatologists' eyes. Finally, when using the synthetic images as a data augmentation technique for training a skin condition classifier, we observe that the model performs comparably to the baseline model overall while improving on rare but malignant conditions.},

abstract = {Early detection of malignant melanoma remains the key factor in lowering mortality from this cancer. Recognizing the importance of this issue 25 years ago, our group at New York University published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians the mnemonic "ABCD" to facilitate the early diagnosis of melanoma. Studies have demonstrated the usefulness of this paradigm in enhancing early melanoma diagnosis as a part of clinical examinations, mass screenings, and public education programs. Approaches to melanoma diagnosis have dynamically evolved during the ensuing quarter century. In the 1990s, dermoscopy enabled the recognition of new subsurface features to differentiate between malignant and benign pigmented lesions. During the last decade, new computer-based technologies have improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and may result in optimizing lesion selection for biopsy and pathology review. Despite all of the advances in melanoma diagnosis, timely recognition, detection, and rapid treatment of melanoma remain critical. Although pathologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosis, this cancer has the potential to be diagnosed through noninvasive approaches because of its cutaneous location. From the development of the ABCDs through current attempts that use complex computer algorithms and genetic markers, a clinician's ability to detect melanoma in its earliest form has been augmented. However, a "good clinical eye" is still fundamental to selecting the lesions for evaluation among the sea of those that are prevalent. As current approaches are refined and new techniques are developed, the improved ability to diagnose this cancer will hopefully enhance reaching the goal of reducing melanoma mortality.},

For data scientists and other users of the toolkit, we have implemented an extensible software architecture that organizes methods according to their place in the AI modeling pipeline. We also discuss enhancements to bring research innovations closer to consumers of explanations, ranging from simplified, more accessible versions of algorithms, to tutorials and an interactive web demo to introduce AI explainability to different audiences and application domains.

@article{Selvaraju2016,
abstract = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs (e.g. VQA) or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine GradCAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on weakly-supervised localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we conduct human studies to measure if GradCAM explanations help users establish trust in predictions from deep networks and show that GradCAM helps untrained users successfully discern a "stronger" deep network from a "weaker" one. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam. A demo and a video of the demo can be found at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org and youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

abstract = {Background: With advances in medical imaging systems, digital dermoscopy has become one of the major imaging modalities in the analysis of skin lesions. Thus, automated segmentation or border detection has a great impact on the subsequent steps of skin cancer computer-aided diagnosis using demoscopy images. Since dermoscopy images suffer from artifacts such as shading and hair, there is a need for automated and robust artifact attenuation removal and lesion border detection. Methods: A method for segmentation of dermoscopy images is proposed based on active contour. To this end, at first, a simple method for hair pixels is restored and a new scheme for shading detection is proposed. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to select the best coefficients for converting RGB to gray level. The obtained gray level image is then used as input for multi Otsu method which provides initial contour for border detection using active contour. Finally, Chan and Vese active contour is used for final lesion border detection. Results: The method is tested on a total of 145 dermoscopic images: 79 cases with benign lesion and 75 cases with melanoma lesion. Mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were obtained 94{\%}, 78.5{\%} and 99{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: Results reveal that the proposed method segments the lesion from dermoscopy images accurately.},

In this paper, we present a fully automatic method for skin lesion segmentation by leveraging 19-layer deep convolutional neural networks that is trained end-to-end and does not rely on prior knowledge of the data. We propose a set of strategies to ensure effective and efficient learning with limited training data. Furthermore, we design a novel loss function based on Jaccard distance to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting, a typical procedure when using cross entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to the strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels. We evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency, as well as the generalization capability of the proposed framework on two publicly available databases. One is from ISBI 2016 skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection challenge, and the other is the PH2 database. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art algorithms on these two databases. Our method is general enough and only needs minimum pre- and post-processing, which allows its adoption in a variety of medical image segmentation tasks.},

This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of the deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood.

Evidence is provided as both the discovered neighbors, as well as localized image regions most relevant to measuring distance between query and neighbors. To ensure that results are relevant in terms of both label accuracy and human visual similarity for any skill level, a novel hierarchical triplet logic is implemented to jointly learn an embedding according to disease labels and non-expert similarity.

Quantitative relevance of results, according to non-expert similarity, as well as localized image regions, are also significantly improved.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) generally and machine learning (ML) specifically demonstrate impressive practical success in many different application domains, e.g. in autonomous driving, speech recognition, or recommender systems. Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we concentrate on three sources: images, *omics data and text. We argue that research in explainable-AI would generally help to facilitate the implementation of AI/ML in the medical domain, and specifically help to facilitate transparency and trust.},

These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature.

There are largely two reasons data collection has recently become a critical issue. First, as machine learning is becoming more widely-used, we are seeing new applications that do not necessarily have enough labeled data. Second, unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning techniques automatically generate features, which saves feature engineering costs, but in return may require larger amounts of labeled data. Interestingly, recent research in data collection comes not only from the machine learning, natural language, and computer vision communities, but also from the data management community due to the importance of handling large amounts of data. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive study of data collection from a data management point of view. Data collection largely consists of data acquisition, data labeling, and improvement of existing data or models. We provide a research landscape of these operations, provide guidelines on which technique to use when, and identify interesting research challenges.

Experimental analyses have begun to shed light on the mechanisms regulating melanoma metastasis and organ specificity, but these analyses are complicated by observations of metastatic dormancy and dissemination of melanocytes that are not yet fully malignant. Additionally, tumor extrinsic factors in the microenvironment, both at the site of the primary tumor and the site of metastasis, play important roles in mediating the metastatic process. As metastasis research moves forward, paradigms explaining melanoma metastasis as a step-wise process must also reflect the temporal complexity and heterogeneity in progression of this disease. Genetic drivers of melanoma as well as extrinsic regulators of disease spread, particularly those that mediate metastasis to specific organs, must also be incorporated into newer models of melanoma metastasis. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are progressively assuming an important role as a computational tool to support clinical diagnosis, namely in the classification of pigmented skin lesions. The current classification methods commonly rely on features derived from shape, colour, or texture, obtained after image segmentation, but these do not always guarantee the best results. To improve the classification accuracy, this work proposes to further exploit the border-line characteristics of the lesion segmentation mask, by combining gradients with local binary patterns (LBP). In the proposed method, these border-line features are used together with the conventional ones to enhance the performance of skin lesion classification algorithms. When the new features are combined with the classical ones, the experimental results show higher accuracy, which impacts positively the overall performance of the classification algorithms. As the medical image datasets usually present large class imbalance, which results in low sensitivity for the classifiers, the border-line features have a positive impact on this classification metric, as evidenced by the experimental results. Both the features' usefulness and their impact are assessed in regard to the classification results, which in turn are statistically tested for completeness, using three different classifiers and two medical image datasets.},

Histopathologically, these dermoscopic characteristics correspond to papillomatous surface of the epidermis, enlarged capillaries of the dermal papillae, pseudohorn cysts in the epidermis opened to the surface of the lesion and intraepidermal cysts, respectively. Clinicians should bear in mind that the clonal type of SK dermoscopically mimics melanoma and BCC by the presence of globule-like structures, while regressing SK exhibits a granular pattern that is similar to the peppering found in melanoma. Furthermore, milia-like cysts alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis of SK because melanoma in rare cases displays cysts along with other SK-like dermoscopic findings.},

In this paper, we propose an automated system that uses an Ant colony based segmentation algorithm, takes into consideration three types of features to describe malignant lesion:geometrical properties, textureand relative colors from which pertinent ones are selected, and uses two classifiers K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The objective of this paper is to test the efficiency of the proposed segmentation algorithm, extract most pertinent features that describe melanomas and compare the two classifiers. Our automated system is tested on 172 dermoscopic images where 88 are malignant melanomas and 84 benign lesions. The results of the proposed segmentation algorithm are encouraging as they gave promising results. 12 features seem to be sufficient to detect malignant melanoma.

abstract = {Bag-of-features (BoF) model based melanoma classification methods can effectively assist dermatologists to diagnose skin diseases. Codebook learning is a key step in the BoF model and the k-means clustering algorithm is often used to learn a codebook. However, the cluster centers generated by k-means algorithm are irresistibly attracted to the denser regions. This produces a suboptimal codebook in which most of the clusters are located in dense regions and a few are in sparse regions. Therefore, this can easily affect the classification accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology for classifying skin lesions. Firstly, we propose a new codebook learning algorithm based on feature similarity measurement (FSM) to effectively quantify the original features of melanomas. We utilize the combination of the linearly independent and linear prediction (LP) algorithms to measure feature similarity. Especially, the codewords learned by the proposed FSM algorithm are not affected by the density of samples. Therefore, a more discriminating BoF histogram for the melanoma classification is achieved. Secondly, we propose a melanoma classification method based on the FSM codebook learning algorithm. In particular, we adopt the BoF histogram fusion strategy of different feature descriptors, i.e., RGB color histogram and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed melanoma classification method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved by the use of the proposed codebook learning algorithm.},

abstract = {Background and objective: Several systems for the diagnosis of melanoma from images of naevi obtained under controlled conditions have demonstrated comparable efficiency with dermatologists. However, their robustness to analyze daily routine images was sometimes questionable. The purpose of this work is to investigate to what extent the automatic melanoma diagnosis may be achieved from the analysis of uncontrolled images of pigmented skin lesions. Materials and methods: Images were acquired during regular practice by two dermatologists using Reflex{\textregistered} 24 × 36 cameras combined with Heine Delta 10 dermascopes. The images were then digitalized using a scanner. In addition, five senior dermatologists were asked to give the diagnosis and therapeutic decision (exeresis) for 227 images of naevi, together with an opinion about the existence of malignancy-predictive features. Meanwhile, a learning by sample classifier for the diagnosis of melanoma was constructed, which combines image-processing with machine-learning techniques. After an automatic segmentation, geometric and colorimetric parameters were extracted from images and selected according to their efficiency in predicting malignancy features. A diagnosis was subsequently provided based on selected parameters. An extensive comparison of dermatologists' and computer results was subsequently performed. Results and conclusion: The KL-PLS-based classifier shows comparable performances with respect to dermatologists (sensitivity: 95{\%} and specificity: 60{\%}). The algorithm provides an original insight into the clinical knowledge of pigmented skin lesions. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

abstract = {Melanoma spreads through metastasis, and therefore, it has been proved to be very fatal. Statistical evidence has revealed that the majority of deaths resulting from skin cancer are as a result of melanoma. Further investigations have shown that the survival rates in patients depend on the stage of the cancer; early detection and intervention of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of melanoma are challenging, since the processes are prone to misdiagnosis and inaccuracies due to doctors' subjectivity. Malignant melanomas are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, notched edges, and color variations, so analyzing the shape, color, and texture of the skin lesion is important for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. This paper proposes the two major components of a noninvasive real-time automated skin lesion analysis system for the early detection and prevention of melanoma. The first component is a real-time alert to help users prevent skinburn caused by sunlight; a novel equation to compute the time for skin to burn is thereby introduced. The second component is an automated image analysis module, which contains image acquisition, hair detection and exclusion, lesion segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed system uses PH2 Dermoscopy image database from Pedro Hispano Hospital for the development and testing purposes. The image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopy images of lesions, including benign, atypical, and melanoma cases. The experimental results show that the proposed system is efficient, achieving classification of the benign, atypical, and melanoma images with accuracy of 96.3{\%}, 95.7{\%}, and 97.5{\%}, respectively.},

Very often, skin cancer is diagnosed at a more advanced stage in POC, making treatment difficult.The purpose of this research was to improve awareness regarding skin cancers in people of color by providing recommendations to clinicians and the general public for early detection and photo protection preventive measures. Methods: Data on different types of skin cancers were presented to POC. Due to limited research, there are few resources providing insights for evaluating darkly pigmented lesions in POC. Diagnostic features for different types of skin cancers were recorded and various possible risk factors were considered. Results: This study provided directions for the prevention and early detection of skin cancer in POC based on a comprehensive review of available data. Conclusions: The increased morbidity and mortality rate associated with skin cancer in POC is due to lack of awareness, diagnosis at a more advanced stage and socioeconomic barriers hindering access to care. Raising public health concerns for skin cancer prevention strategies for all people, regardless of ethnic background and socioeconomic status, is the key to timely diagnosis and treatment.},

Simultaneously, BCM pursues sparsity by learning subspaces, the sets of features that play important roles in the characterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation provides quantitative benefits in inter-pretability while preserving classification accuracy.

abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

abstract = {Background: Computer vision has promise in image-based cutaneous melanoma diagnosis but clinical utility is uncertain. Objective: To determine if computer algorithms from an international melanoma detection challenge can improve dermatologists' accuracy in diagnosing melanoma. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we used 150 dermoscopy images (50 melanomas, 50 nevi, 50 seborrheic keratoses) from the test dataset of a melanoma detection challenge, along with algorithm results from 23 teams. Eight dermatologists and 9 dermatology residents classified dermoscopic lesion images in an online reader study and provided their confidence level. Results: The top-ranked computer algorithm had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87, which was higher than that of the dermatologists (0.74) and residents (0.66) (P {\textless} .001 for all comparisons). At the dermatologists' overall sensitivity in classification of 76.0{\%}, the algorithm had a superior specificity (85.0{\%} vs. 72.6{\%}, P = .001). Imputation of computer algorithm classifications into dermatologist evaluations with low confidence ratings (26.6{\%} of evaluations) increased dermatologist sensitivity from 76.0{\%} to 80.8{\%} and specificity from 72.6{\%} to 72.8{\%}. Limitations: Artificial study setting lacking the full spectrum of skin lesions as well as clinical metadata. Conclusion: Accumulating evidence suggests that deep neural networks can classify skin images of melanoma and its benign mimickers with high accuracy and potentially improve human performance.},

abstract = {Background/Purpose: It is known that the standard features for lesion classification are ABCD features, that is, asymmetry, border irregularity, colour variegation and diameter of lesion. However, the observation that skin patterning tends to be disrupted by malignant but not by benign skin lesions suggests that measurements of skin pattern disruption on simply captured white light optical skin images could be a useful contribution to a diagnostic feature set. Previous work using both skin line direction and intensity for lesion classification was encouraging. But these features have not been combined with the ABCD features. This paper explores the possibility of combing features from skin pattern and ABCD analysis to enhance classification performance. Methods: The skin line direction and intensity were extracted from a local tensor matrix of skin pattern. Meanwhile, ABCD analysis was conducted to generate six features. They were asymmetry, border irregularity, colour (red, green and blue) variegations and diameter of lesion. The eight features of each case were combined using a principal component analysis (PCA) to produce two dominant features for lesion classification. Results: A larger set of images containing malignant melanoma (MM) and benign naevi were processed as above and the scatter plot in a two-dimensional dominant feature space showed excellent separation of benign and malignant lesions. An ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plot enclosed an area of 0.94. Conclusions: The classification results showed that the individual features have a limited discrimination capability and the combined features were promising to distinguish MM from benign lesion. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Munksgaard 2007.},

In this research, a new procedure to detect malignant melanoma from benign pigmented lesions using macroscopic images is presented. The images are taken by conventional digital cameras with spatial resolution higher than one megapixel and by considering no constraints and special conditions during imaging. In the proposed procedure, new methods to weaken the effect of nonuniform illumination, correction of the effect of thick hairs and large glows on the lesion and also, a new threshold-based segmentation algorithm are presented. 187 features representing asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter and texture are extracted from the lesion area and after reducing the number of features using principal component analysis (PCA), lesions are determined as malignant or benign using support vector machine classifier. According to the dermatologist diagnosis, the proposed processing methods have the ability to detect lesions area with high accuracy. The evaluation measures of classification have indicated that 13 features extracted by PCA method lead to better results than all of the extracted features. These results led to an accuracy of 82.2{\%}, sensitivity of 77{\%} and specificity of 86.93{\%}. The proposed method may help dermatologists to detect the malignant lesions in the primary stages due to the minimum constraints during imaging, the ease of usage by the public and nonexperts, and high accuracy in detection of the lesion type.},

abstract = {Dermoscopy is a noninvasive skin imaging technique, which permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. Color information is indispensable for the clinical diagnosis malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. For this reason, most of the currently accepted dermoscopic scoring systems either directly or indirectly incorporate color as a diagnostic criterion. For example, both the asymmetry, border, colors, and dermoscopic (ABCD) rule of dermoscopy and the more recent color, architecture, symmetry, and homogeneity (CASH) algorithm include the number of clinically significant colors in their calculation of malignancy scores. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the automated quantification of clinically significant colors in dermoscopy images. Given a true-color dermoscopy image with N colors, we first reduce the number of colors in this image to a small number K, i.e., K N, using the K-means clustering algorithm incorporating a spatial term. The optimal K value for the image is estimated separately using five commonly used cluster validity criteria. We then train a symbolic regression algorithm using the estimates given by these criteria, which are calculated on a set of 617 images. Finally, the mathematical equation given by the regression algorithm is used for two-class (benign versus malignant) classification. The proposed approach yields a sensitivity of 62{\%} and a specificity of 76{\%} on an independent test set of 297 images. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. In current practice, dermatologists determine lesion area by manually drawing lesion borders. Therefore, automated assessment tools for dermoscopy images have become an important research field mainly because of inter- and intra-observer variations in human interpretation. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is automated detection of lesion borders. To our knowledge, in our 2010 study we achieved one of the highest accuracy rates in the automated lesion border detection field by using modified density based clustering algorithm. In the previous study, we proposed a novel method which removes redundant computations in well-known spatial density based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN; thus, in turn it speeds up clustering process considerably.Findings: Our previous study was heavily dependent on the pre-processing step which creates a binary image from original image. In this study, we embed a new distance measure to the existing algorithm. This provides twofold benefits. First, since new approach removes pre-processing step, it directly works on color images instead of binary ones. Thus, very important color information is not lost. Second, accuracy of delineated lesion borders is improved on 75{\%} of 100 dermoscopy image dataset.Conclusion: Previous and improved methods are tested within the same dermoscopy dataset along with the same set of dermatologist drawn ground truth images. Results revealed that the improved method directly works on color images without any pre-processing and generates more accurate results than existing method. {\textcopyright} 2011 Suer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature.

This cancer can be categorized into two main types; Melanoma, which is the deadliest form, and Non-Melanoma. Early melanoma detection and diagnosis allows more treatment options and decreases significantly the number of deaths. Many researchers proposed to use image processing for skin lesion detection. The process can be divided into three main stages: lesion identification based on image segmentation, features extraction and lesion classification. Segmentation and features extraction are the key-steps and significantly influence the outcome of the classification results. In this paper, an improved segmentation approach for skin lesion detection and classification has been proposed. The proposed approach consists on a pre-processing based on multiscale decomposition thats separate the input image into two components. The geometrical component will be used in the segmentation stage and the texture component in features extraction. The efficiency and the performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated in comparison with recent and robust dermoscopic approaches from literature.},

abstract = {Recent research revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence over dermatologists to diagnose melanoma from images. However, 30–50{\%} of all melanomas and more than half of those in young patients evolve from initially benign lesions. Despite its high relevance for melanoma screening, neither clinicians nor computers are yet able to reliably predict a nevus' oncologic transformation. The cause of this lies in the static nature of lesion presentation in the current standard of care, both for clinicians and algorithms. The status quo makes it difficult to train algorithms (and clinicians) to precisely assess the likelihood of a benign skin lesion to transform into melanoma. In addition, it inhibits the precision of current algorithms since ‘evolution' image features may not be part of their decision. The current literature reveals certain types of melanocytic nevi (i.e. ‘spitzoid' or ‘dysplastic' nevi) and criteria (i.e. visible vasculature) that, in general, appear to have a higher chance to transform into melanoma. However, owing to the cumulative nature of oncogenic mutations in melanoma, a more fine-grained early morphologic footprint is likely to be detectable by an algorithm. In this perspective article, the concept of melanoma prediction is further explored by the discussion of the evolution of melanoma, the concept for training of such a nevi classifier and the implications of early melanoma prediction for clinical practice. In conclusion, the authors believe that artificial intelligence trained on prospective image data could be transformative for skin cancer diagnostics by (a) predicting melanoma before it occurs (i.e. pre-in situ) and (b) further enhancing the accuracy of current melanoma classifiers. Necessary prospective images for this research are obtained via free mole-monitoring mobile apps.},

abstract = {Skin lesion analysis using standard camera images has received limited attention from the scientific community due to its technical complexity and scarcity of data. The images are privy to lighting variations caused by uneven source lighting, and unconstrained differences in resolution, scale, and equipment. In this chapter, we propose a framework that performs illumination correction and feature extraction on photographs of skin lesions acquired using standard consumer-grade cameras. We apply a multi-stage illumination correction algorithm and define a set of high-level intuitive features (HLIF) that quantifies the level of asymmetry and border irregularity about a lesion. This lighting-corrected intuitive feature model framework can be used to classify skin lesion diagnoses with high accuracy. The framework accurately corrects the illumination variations and achieves high and precise sensitivity (95 {\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval (CI), 73.1--73.5 {\{}{\%}{\}}) and specificity (95 {\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 72.0--72.4 {\{}{\%}{\}}) using a linear support vector machine classifier with cross-validation trials. It exhibits higher test-retest reliability than the much larger state-of-the-art low-level feature set (95 {\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 78.1--79.7 {\{}{\%}{\}} sensitivity, 75.3--76.3 {\{}{\%}{\}} specificity). Combining our framework with these low-level features attains sensitivity (95 {\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 83.3--84.8 {\{}{\%}{\}}) and specificity (95 {\{}{\%}{\}} CI, 79.7--80.1 {\{}{\%}{\}}), which is more accurate and reliable than classification using the low-level feature set.},

abstract = {Background: Automated skin lesion border examination and analysis techniques have become an important field of research for distinguishing malignant pigmented lesions from benign lesions. An abrupt pigment pattern cutoff at the periphery of a skin lesion is one of the most important dermoscopic features for detection of neoplastic behavior. In current clinical setting, the lesion is divided into a virtual pie with eight sections. Each section is examined by a dermatologist for abrupt cutoff and scored accordingly, which can be tedious and subjective. Methods: This study introduces a novel approach to objectively quantify abruptness of pigment patterns along the lesion periphery. In the proposed approach, first, the skin lesion border is detected by the density based lesion border detection method. Second, the detected border is gradually scaled through vector operations. Then, along gradually scaled borders, pigment pattern homogeneities are calculated at different scales. Through this process, statistical texture features are extracted. Moreover, different color spaces are examined for the efficacy of texture analysis. Results: The proposed method has been tested and validated on 100 (31 melanoma, 69 benign) dermoscopy images. Analyzed results indicate that proposed method is efficient on malignancy detection. More specifically, we obtained specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.86 for malignancy detection in a certain color space. The F-measure, harmonic mean of recall and precision, of the framework is reported as 0.87. Conclusions: The use of texture homogeneity along the periphery of the lesion border is an effective method to detect malignancy of the skin lesion in dermoscopy images. Among different color spaces tested, RGB color space's blue color channel is the most informative color channel to detect malignancy for skin lesions. That is followed by YCbCr color spaces Cr channel, and Cr is closely followed by the green color channel of RGB color space.},

The proposed method combines the enhanced fusion saliency with adaptive thresholding based on wavelet transform to get the lesion regions. Firstly, a fusion saliency map increases the contract of the skin lesion and healthy skin, and then an adaptive thresholding method based on wavelet transform is used to obtain more accurate lesion regions.

abstract = {Background: Clustering is a key step in the analysis of gene expression data, and in fact, many classical clustering algorithms are used, or more innovative ones have been designed and validated for the task. Despite the widespread use of artificial intelligence techniques in bioinformatics and, more generally, data analysis, there are very few clustering algorithms based on the genetic paradigm, yet that paradigm has great potential in finding good heuristic solutions to a difficult optimization problem such as clustering. Results: GenClust is a new genetic algorithm for clustering gene expression data. It has two key features: (a) a novel coding of the search space that is simple, compact and easy to update; (b) it can be used naturally in conjunction with data driven internal validation methods. We have experimented with the FOM methodology, specifically conceived for validating clusters of gene expression data. The validity of GenClust has been assessed experimentally on real data sets, both with the use of validation measures and in comparison with other algorithms, i.e., Average Link, Cast, Click and K-means. Conclusions: Experiments show that none of the algorithms we have used is markedly superior to the others across data sets and validation measures; i.e., in many cases the observed differences between the worst and best performing algorithm may be statistically insignificant and they could be considered equivalent. However, there are cases in which an algorithm may be better than others and therefore worthwhile. In particular, experiments for GenClust show that, although simple in its data representation, it converges very rapidly to a local optimum and that its ability to identify meaningful clusters is comparable, and sometimes superior, to that of more sophisticated algorithms. In addition, it is well suited for use in conjunction with data driven internal validation measures and, in particular, the FOM methodology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Di Gesu et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees, and gradient boosted trees are the most popular non-linear predictive models used in practice today, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we significantly improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions: 1) The first polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. 2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. 3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to i) identify high magnitude but low frequency non-linear mortality risk factors in the general US population, ii) highlight distinct population sub-groups with shared risk characteristics, iii) identify non-linear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease, and iv) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

abstract = {Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for melanoma detection have received a lot of attention during the last decades because of the utmost importance of detecting this type of skin cancer in its early stages. However, despite of the many research efforts devoted to this matter, these systems are not used yet in everyday clinical practice. Very likely, this is due to two main reasons: 1) the accuracy of the systems is not high enough; and 2) they simply provide a parallel diagnosis that actually does not help to the doctors (as long as there is no way to interpret it). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims to provide the doctor with an enriched diagnosis. Specifically, we rely on a dermoscopic-structure-based soft segmentation to design a set of structure-specific classifiers. Each individual structure-specific classifier is trained to distinguish benign lesions from melanomas just paying attention to one type of dermoscopic structure. Then, the outputs of the individual classifiers are combined by a means of the Bayesian method that, besides the final diagnosis, provide the doctor with additional valuable information, such as the opinions of the individual structure-specific experts and the uncertainty of the diagnosis. The results in terms of the features selected for the structure-specific classifiers are consistent with the expert insights. Furthermore, regarding the automatic melanoma diagnosis problem, the proposed method has been assessed on two different datasets, and the experimental results revealed that the proposed system clearly outperforms other methods in two datasets and compares well with the official submissions of the ISBI 2016 challenge on melanoma detection. Moreover, the system performance is equivalent to that of a well-known dermoscopy expert and its combination with the human diagnosis surpasses the human performance.},

Dermoscopy images of pigmented lesions are most commonly taken at × 10 magnification under lighting at a low angle of incidence while the skin is immersed in oil under a glass plate. Accurate skin lesion segmentation from the background skin is important because some of the features anticipated to be used for diagnosis deal with shape of the lesion and others deal with the color of the lesion compared with the color of the surrounding skin. Methods: In this research, gradient vector flow (GVF) snakes are investigated to find the border of skin lesions in dermoscopy images. An automatic initialization method is introduced to make the skin lesion border determination process fully automated. Results: Skin lesion segmentation results are presented for 70 benign and 30 melanoma skin lesion images for the GVF-based method and a color histogram analysis technique. The average errors obtained by the GVF-based method are lower for both the benign and melanoma image sets than for the color histogram analysis technique based on comparison with manually segmented lesions determined by a dermatologist.

abstract = {Background Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) of malignant melanoma (MM) has been advocated to help clinicians to achieve a more objective and reliable assessment. However, conventional CAD systems examine only the features extracted from digital photographs of lesions. Failure to incorporate patients' personal information constrains the applicability in clinical settings. Objectives To develop a new CAD system to improve the performance of automatic diagnosis of melanoma, which, for the first time, incorporates digital features of lesions with important patient metadata into a learning process. Methods Thirty-two features were extracted from digital photographs to characterize skin lesions. Patients' personal information, such as age, gender and, lesion site, and their combinations, was quantified as metadata. The integration of digital features and metadata was realized through an extended Laplacian eigenmap, a dimensionality-reduction method grouping lesions with similar digital features and metadata into the same classes. Results The diagnosis reached 82{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} sensitivity and 86{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} specificity when only multidimensional digital features were used, but improved to 95{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} sensitivity and 91{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} specificity after metadata were incorporated appropriately. The proposed system achieves a level of sensitivity comparable with experienced dermatologists aided by conventional dermoscopes. This demonstrates the potential of our method for assisting clinicians in diagnosing melanoma, and the benefit it could provide to patients and hospitals by greatly reducing unnecessary excisions of benign naevi. Conclusions This paper proposes an enhanced CAD system incorporating clinical metadata into the learning process for automatic classification of melanoma. Results demonstrate that the additional metadata and the mechanism to incorporate them are useful for improving CAD of melanoma. What's already known about this topic? Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) of melanoma has been advocated to improve clinical diagnostic accuracy. Existing CAD systems can only partially simulate the procedure adopted by dermatologists in making a diagnosis. What does this study add? In addition to information on the individual lesion itself, patient metadata are, for the first time, incorporated to form a new CAD system for melanoma diagnosis. The integration of clinical metadata helps to improve the performance of automatic identification of melanoma. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Association of Dermatologists.},

abstract = {Asymmetry, color variegation and diameter are considered strong indicators of malignant melanoma. The subjectivity inherent in the first two features and the fact that 10{\%} of melanomas tend to be missed in the early diagnosis due to having a diameter less than 6mm, deem it necessary to develop an objective computer vision system to evaluate these criteria and aid in the early detection of melanoma which could eventually lead to a higher 5-year survival rate. This paper proposes an approach for evaluating the three criteria objectively, whereby we develop a measure to find asymmetry with the aid of a decision tree which we train on the extracted asymmetry measures and then use to predict the asymmetry of new skin lesion images. A range of colors that demonstrate the suspicious colors for the color variegation feature have been derived, and Feret's diameter has been utilized to find the diameter of the skin lesion. The decision tree is 80{\%} accurate in determining the asymmetry of skin lesions, and the number of suspicious colors and diameter values are objectively identified.},

abstract = {In his seminal book The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy And How To Restore The Sanity [2004, Sams Indianapolis, IN, USA], Alan Cooper argues that a major reason why software is often poorly designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers are in charge of design decisions, rather than interaction designers. As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience; a phenomenon he refers to as the ‘inmates running the asylum'. This paper argues that ex- plainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users. But ex- plainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science; and if evalu- ation of these models is focused more on people than on technology. From a light scan of litera- ture, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural sciences into explainable AI, and present some key results from these fields that are relevant to explainable AI.},

abstract = {Background: Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with highest mortality rate. However, the annihilation in its early stage implies a high survival rate therefore, it demands early diagnosis. The accustomed diagnosis methods are costly and cumbersome due to the involvement of experienced experts as well as the requirements for the highly equipped environment. The recent advancements in computerized solutions for this diagnosis are highly promising with improved accuracy and efficiency. Methods: In this article, a method for the identification and classification of the lesion based on probabilistic distribution and best features selection is proposed. The probabilistic distribution such as normal distribution and uniform distribution are implemented for segmentation of lesion in the dermoscopic images. Then multi-level features are extracted and parallel strategy is performed for fusion. A novel entropy-based method with the combination of Bhattacharyya distance and variance are calculated for the selection of best features. Only selected features are classified using multi-class support vector machine, which is selected as a base classifier. Results: The proposed method is validated on three publicly available datasets such as PH2, ISIC (i.e. ISIC MSK-2 and ISIC UDA), and Combined (ISBI 2016 and ISBI 2017), including multi-resolution RGB images and achieved accuracy of 97.5{\%}, 97.75{\%}, and 93.2{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: The base classifier performs significantly better on proposed features fusion and selection method as compared to other methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Furthermore, the presented method achieved satisfactory segmentation results on selected datasets.},

The ability to synthesize realistic looking images of skin lesions could act as a reliever for the aforementioned problems. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to synthesize realistically looking medical images, however limited to low resolution, whereas machine learning models for challenging tasks such as skin lesion segmentation or classification benefit from much higher resolution data. In this work, we successfully synthesize realistically looking images of skin lesions with GANs at such high resolution. Therefore, we utilize the concept of progressive growing, which we both quantitatively and qualitatively compare to other GAN architectures such as the DCGAN and the LAPGAN. Our results show that with the help of progressive growing, we can synthesize highly realistic dermoscopic images of skin lesions that even expert dermatologists find hard to distinguish from real ones.},

@article{Andre2017,
abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images - two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets - consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

abstract = {Melanoma is considered to be one of the deadliest skin cancer types, whose occurring frequency elevated in the last few years; its earlier diagnosis, however, significantly increases the chances of patients' survival. In the quest for the same, a few computer based methods, capable of diagnosing the skin lesion at initial stages, have been recently proposed. Despite some success, however, margin exists, due to which the machine learning community still considers this an outstanding research challenge. In this work, we come up with a novel framework for skin lesion classification, which integrates deep features information to generate most discriminant feature vector, with an advantage of preserving the original feature space. We utilize recent deep models for feature extraction, and by taking advantage of transfer learning. Initially, the dermoscopic images are segmented, and the lesion region is extracted, which is later subjected to retrain the selected deep models to generate fused feature vectors. In the second phase, a framework for most discriminant feature selection and dimensionality reduction is proposed, entropy-controlled neighborhood component analysis (ECNCA). This hierarchical framework optimizes fused features by selecting the principle components and extricating the redundant and irrelevant data. The effectiveness of our design is validated on four benchmark dermoscopic datasets; PH2, ISIC MSK, ISIC UDA, and ISBI-2017. To authenticate the proposed method, a fair comparison with the existing techniques is also provided. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed design is accurate enough to categorize the skin lesion with 98.8{\%}, 99.2{\%} and 97.1{\%} and 95.9{\%} accuracy with the selected classifiers on all four datasets, and by utilizing less than 3{\%} features.},

Various pigmented structures, including pigment network, dots and globules, and streaks, are observed in dermoscopy.

However, because the image of dermoscopy is horizontal, it is difficult for the horizontal view of dermoscopy to refer to the vertical view of histopathology.

The algorithm groups image pixels with homogeneous properties, and merges the pixel groups into a few super-regions. The optimal lesionskin boundary is chosen from the set of all region boundaries, where the optimality is determined from the color and texture properties of the regions.

In addition, a set of visual attributes is provided by the examining physician. The automatically extracted descriptors and the attributes provided by the physician are separately used for automatic prediction. Final classification is achieved by a majority vote of all predictions. The proposed system achieves high diagnostic accuracy results (81{\%}) and performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods that are using dermoscopic images, though such images contain more detailed information and are subject to less noise and illumination effects. The simple input requirements and the robustness of its descriptors allow MED-NODE to be an effective tool within the diagnostic process for melanoma. In addition, the modular nature of the system allows for it to be easily extended.},

This study sought to define several optical parameters across malignant and benign tissue types. Study Design: Prospective pilot trial utilizing the Zenalux IM1 optical spectroscopy device from April 2016 to February 2017. For each skin lesion, provider pre-biopsy probability of malignancy was compared to histolopathologic diagnosis. Optical data were characterized across basal cell carcinoma (BCC; n = 9), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; n = 5), actinic keratosis (AK; n = 4), scar tissue (n = 6), nevus (n = 2), and neurofibroma (NF; n = 1). Across all patients, agreement was determined between control measurements collected adjacent to the lesion and from the upper extremity. Methods: Prospective single center pilot study. The optical properties of 27 cutaneous lesions were collected from 18 adult patients presenting to Otolaryngology and Dermatology clinics with suspicious skin lesions warranting biopsy. Spectroscopy measurements were recorded for each lesion: two at the lesion site, two at an adjacent site (internal control), and one at the central medial upper extremity (arm control). Variables of interest included absolute oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), Hb saturation, total Hb concentration, and Eumelanin concentration. For each lesion, internal control averages were subtracted from lesion averages to provide delta parameter values, and lesion averages were divided by internal control averages to provide ratio parameter values. Results: Mean percent difference between pre-biopsy probability of malignancy and histology was 29{\%}, with a difference of 75{\%} or greater seen in 5 of 25 lesions. Mean values for BCC, SCC, AK, and scar tissue varied most between extracted mean reduced scatter estimate maacm−) delta values (BCC: −2.2 ± 3.8; SCC: −3.9 ± 2.0; AK: −3.3 ± 4.2, Scar: −1.7 ± 1.2) and total Hb (µM) ratio (BCC: 2.0 ± 3.3; SCC: 3.0 ± 1.3; AK: 1.1 ± 0.6; Scar: 1.4 ± 1.1). Agreement between local and arm controls was poor. Conclusion: This pilot trial utilizes optical spectroscopy as a noninvasive method for determining cutaneous lesion histology. Effect sizes observed across optical parameters for benign and malignant tissue types will guide larger prospective studies that may ultimately lead to prediction of lesional histology without need for invasive biopsy.

abstract = {Importance: The recent advances in the field of machine learning have raised expectations that computer-aided diagnosis will become the standard for the diagnosis of melanoma. Objective: To critically review the current literature and compare the diagnostic accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis with that of human experts. Data Sources: The MEDLINE, arXiv, and PubMed Central databases were searched to identify eligible studies published between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018. Study Selection: Studies that reported on the accuracy of automated systems for melanoma were selected. Search terms included melanoma, diagnosis, detection, computer aided, and artificial intelligence. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Evaluation of the risk of bias was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and quality assessment was based on predefined criteria. Data were analyzed from February 1 to March 10, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were the primary outcomes. Results: The literature search yielded 1694 potentially eligible studies, of which 132 were included and 70 offered sufficient information for a quantitative analysis. Most studies came from the field of computer science. Prospective clinical studies were rare. Combining the results for automated systems gave a melanoma sensitivity of 0.74 (95{\%} CI, 0.66-0.80) and a specificity of 0.84 (95{\%} CI, 0.79-0.88). Sensitivity was lower in studies that used independent test sets than in those that did not (0.51; 95{\%} CI, 0.34-0.69 vs 0.82; 95{\%} CI, 0.77-0.86; P {\textless}.001); however, the specificity was similar (0.83; 95{\%} CI, 0.71-0.91 vs 0.85; 95{\%} CI, 0.80-0.88; P =.67). In comparison with dermatologists' diagnosis, computer-aided diagnosis showed similar sensitivities and a 10 percentage points lower specificity, but the difference was not statistically significant. Studies were heterogeneous and substantial risk of bias was found in all but 4 of the 70 studies included in the quantitative analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: Although the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis for melanoma detection is comparable to that of experts, the real-world applicability of these systems is unknown and potentially limited owing to overfitting and the risk of bias of the studies at hand.},

abstract = {We propose an attention-based method for melanoma recognition. The attention modules, which are learned together with other network parameters, estimate attention maps that highlight image regions of interest that are relevant to lesion classification. These attention maps provide a more interpretable output as opposed to only outputting a class label. Additionally, we propose to utilize prior information by regularizing attention maps with regions of interest (ROIs) (e.g.,{\^{A}} lesion segmentation or dermoscopic features). Whenever such prior information is available, both the classification performance and the attention maps can be further refined. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce an end-to-end trainable attention module with regularization for melanoma recognition. We provide both quantitative and qualitative results on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/SaoYan/IPMI2019-AttnMel.},

abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to synthesize realistically looking images of faces, scenery and even medical images. Unfortunately, they usually require large training datasets, which are often scarce in the medical field, and to the best of our knowledge GANs have been only applied for medical image synthesis at fairly low resolution. However, many state-of-the-art machine learning models operate on high resolution data as such data carries indispensable, valuable information. In this work, we try to generate realistically looking high resolution images of skin lesions with GANs, using only a small training dataset of 2000 samples. The nature of the data allows us to do a direct comparison between the image statistics of the generated samples and the real dataset. We both quantitatively and qualitatively compare state-of-the-art GAN architectures such as DCGAN and LAPGAN against a modification of the latter for the task of image generation at a resolution of 256x256px. Our investigation shows that we can approximate the real data distribution with all of the models, but we notice major differences when visually rating sample realism, diversity and artifacts. In a set of use-case experiments on skin lesion classification, we further show that we can successfully tackle the problem of heavy class imbalance with the help of synthesized high resolution melanoma samples.},

abstract = {Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) comprises mainly basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The association between alcohol intake and NMSC has been inconclusive; therefore the objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between alcohol intake and NMSC using meta-analyses. A systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase was performed on 30 October 2016. Eligible articles were case–control or cohort studies that examined alcohol intake and risk of BCC or cSCC and reported relative risks (RRs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). Of the 307 articles identified, 13 case–control and cohort studies were included in the systematic review, including 95 241 NMSC cases (91 942 BCC and 3299 cSCC cases). A random-effects model was used to obtain summary RRs and 95{\%} CIs for dose–response meta-analyses. For every 10-gram increase in ethanol intake per day, a positive association was found for both BCC (summary RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}07; 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}04–1{\textperiodcentered}09) and cSCC (summary RR of 1{\textperiodcentered}11; 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}06–1{\textperiodcentered}16). While there was evidence suggesting a nonlinear association for BCC, it may be due to the sparse data at higher alcohol intake levels. This meta-analysis found evidence that alcohol drinking is positively associated with both BCC and cSCC risk in a dose-dependent manner. These results should be interpreted with caution due to potential residual confounding. Nonetheless, because alcohol drinking is a prevalent and modifiable behaviour, it could serve as an important public health target to reduce the global health burden of NMSC.},

However, as many of these systems are opaque in their operation, there is a growing demand for such systems to provide explanations for their decisions. Conventional approaches to this problem attempt to expose or discover the inner workings of a machine learning model with the hope that the resulting explanations will be meaningful to the consumer. In contrast, this paper suggests a new approach to this problem. It introduces a simple, practical framework, called Teaching Explanations for Decisions (TED), that provides meaningful explanations that match the mental model of the consumer. We illustrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach with two different examples, resulting in highly accurate explanations with no loss of prediction accuracy for these two examples.},

We reformulate the task of classifying clinical dermoscopic features within superpixels as a segmentation problem, and propose a fully convolutional neural network to detect clinical dermoscopic features from dermoscopy skin lesion images. Our neural network architecture uses interpolated feature maps from several intermediate network layers, and addresses imbalanced labels by minimizing a negative multilabel Dice-F 1 score, where the score is computed across the minibatch for each label. Our approach ranked first place in the 2017 ISIC-ISBI Part 2: Dermoscopic Feature Classification Task, challenge over both the provided validation and test datasets, achieving a 0.895{\%} area under the receiver operator characteristic curve score. We show how simple baseline models can outrank state-of-the-art approaches when using the official metrics of the challenge, and propose to use a fuzzy Jaccard Index that ignores the empty set (i.e., masks devoid of positive pixels) when ranking models. Our results suggest that the classification of clinical dermoscopic features can be effectively approached as a segmentation problem, and the current metrics used to rank models may not well capture the efficacy of the model. We plan to make our trained model and code publicly available.},

abstract = {One of the important clinical features that differentiates benign melanocytic nevi from malignant melanomas is the irregularity of the lesion border. There are two types of border irregularities: texture irregularities, the small variations along the border, and structure irregularities, the global indentations and protrusions. Texture irregularities are subject to noise, whereas structure irregularities may suggest excessive cell growth or regression of a melanoma. We have designed a new algorithm for measuring the structure irregularities in the border. Our algorithm first locates all the local and global indentations and protrusions and organizes them in a hierarchical structure. Then an area-based index, called the irregularity index, is computed for each indentation and protrusion along the border. From the individual irregularity indices, two important new measures, the most significant irregularity index and the overall irregularity index are derived. These two new indices provide a measure of the degree of irregularity along the lesion border. A double-blinded test was performed to examine the effectiveness of these two new indices. Fourteen experienced dermatologists were asked to evaluate the borders of 40 pigmented lesions. The clinical evaluation result was then compared with the two new indices and other published shape measurements. The user study showed that both of the new indices vastly outperformed the other shape descriptors. Moreover, our algorithm captured the knowledge of expert dermatologists in analysing malignancy of a lesion based on its shape alone, indicating that the new measures may be useful for diagnosing melanomas. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, exactly what kinds of explanation are truly human-interpretable remains poorly understood. This work advances our understanding of what makes explanations interpretable under three specific tasks that users may perform with machine learning systems: simulation of the response, verification of a suggested response, and determining whether the correctness of a suggested response changes under a change to the inputs. Through carefully controlled human-subject experiments, we identify regularizers that can be used to optimize for the interpretability of machine learning systems. Our results show that the type of complexity matters: cognitive chunks (newly defined concepts) affect performance more than variable repetitions, and these trends are consistent across tasks and domains. This suggests that there may exist some common design principles for explanation systems.},

We propose to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress lighting parameters from a single face image. Lacking massive ground truth lighting labels for face images in the wild, we use an existing method to estimate lighting parameters, which are treated as ground truth with noise. To alleviate the effect of such noise, we utilize the idea of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and propose a Label Denoising Adversarial Network (LDAN). LDAN makes use of synthetic data with accurate ground truth to help train a deep CNN for lighting regression on real face images. Experiments show that our network outperforms existing methods in producing consistent lighting parameters of different faces under similar lighting conditions. To further evaluate the proposed method, we also apply it to regress object 2D key points where ground truth labels are available. Our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on this application.},

abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) is critical for various clinical applications, e.g., radiotherapy treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction. However, CT exposes radiation during CT imaging, which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much safer and does not involve any radiation. Therefore, recently researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper, we propose a 3D deep learning based method to address this challenging problem. Specifically, a 3D fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is adopted to learn an endto-end nonlinear mapping from MR image to CT image. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), FCN generates structured output and can better preserve the neighborhood information in the predicted CT image. We have validated our method in a real pelvic CT/MRI dataset. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT image from MRI image, and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison. In addition, the parameters, such as network depth and activation function, are extensively studied to give an insight for deep learning based regression tasks in our application.},

abstract = {A 48-year-old woman presented with a 3 mm, pigmented macule at her first visit to our clinic. The macule, which showed complete symmetry and a typical network, was tentatively diagnosed as a Clark nevus; a 6-month follow-up was recommended, and the patient returned 7 months later. At the second visit, the lesion had enlarged to a diameter of 5 mm, and dermoscopy revealed that it had maintained its typical pigment network. At this point, evidence-based monitoring would have led to excision but the decision was made to continue monitoring. Owing to poor compliance, the patient went another 2 years without follow-up. When we assess small lesions, such as this, the usefulness of dermoscopy is apparent. Additionally, we examined the benefits and drawbacks of high dynamic range (HDR) conversion of the dermoscopy images and their helpfulness for inspecting small lesions. Although the delicate structures present in the lesion can be recognized by a dermoscopy expert and HDR image conversion has a capacity to highlight important structures, there is also a risk that HDR image conversion may mask some of the structural changes. However, a comparison of the original dermoscopy images with the HDR-converted images provides newly trained dermoscopists the opportunity to recognize new findings and to distinguish the differences in the findings between both the types of images. Therefore, such comparisons might be useful for obtaining an accurate diagnosis by using dermoscopy and HDR image conversion.},

Results: Eight published studies were included in the analysis, involving 1141 skin lesions, which reported a per-lesion analysis of dermoscopy and RCM. Within the same patient group and at the per-lesion level, RCM significantly increased the detection rate of malignant skin tumours by 7.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.01–0.14). The pooled sensitivity of dermoscopy was similar to RCM [88.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.85–0.91) vs. 93.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.91–0.96)]. The specificity of dermoscopy was significantly lower than that of RCM [52.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.49–0.57) vs. 80.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.77–0.83)]. The pooled ADR of RCM for melanoma detection was 4.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.002–0.08). Pooled sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopy for melanoma detection were 88.4{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.84–0.92) and 49.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.45–0.53), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of RCM were 93.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.90–0.96) and 78.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.75–0.82), respectively. Conclusions: When compared with dermoscopy, RCM has a significantly greater diagnostic specificity for malignant skin tumours and so could improve their detection rate.},

Varied appearances can sometimes make it difficult to differentiate benign lesions from malignant lesions such as melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer found in humans. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the statistical occurrence of MLCs in benign vs. malignant lesions. Methods A medical student with 10 months experience in examining approximately 1000 dermoscopy images and a dermoscopy-na{\"{i}}ve observer analysed contact non-polarized dermoscopy images of 221 malignant melanomas and 175 seborrheic keratoses for presence of MLCs. Results The observers found two different types of MLCs present: large ones described as cloudy and smaller ones described as starry. Starry MLCs were found to be prevalent in both seborrheic keratoses and melanomas. Cloudy MLCs, however, were found to have 99.1{\%} specificity for seborrheic keratoses among this group of seborrheic keratoses and melanomas. Conclusion Cloudy MLCs can be a useful tool for differentiating between seborrheic keratoses and melanomas. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Introduction: Location of malignant melanoma lesions depends on environmental, genetic, sociological and demographical factors. Available sources do not provide enough information on such dependencies in various populations. There is no data concerning the role of socio-demographic factors for the population of the Central and Eastern Europe. Aim: The aim of this work was to evaluate the anatomical location of the primary malignant melanoma lesion in correlation to patients' gender and age. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of medical documentation of 363 patients has been performed. The patients had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma and were undergoing treatment in the years 2010-2014 in two Polish oncologic hospitals. The subject group consisted of 199 (55{\%}) females and 164 (45{\%}) males. The age varied between 19 - 90 years, with the median of 62 years. Results: In women, the melanoma lesions seem to appear more often in their lower extremities, while in case of men such lesions seem to be more often on their torsos. In both cases, the difference was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01 When the specific locations are considered in women the lesions were more often located on their shins (p {\textless} 0.01), whereas for men the lesions were located on their backs (p {\textless} 0.01). It has been observed that there is dependency between lesion localization and age of patients. The lesions located on heads and necks were most common in older patients, and the lesions located in lower extremities were most common in younger ones. Conclusion: Differences in location of malignant melanoma lesions may be due to either genetic or environmental reasons. It is often emphasized in literature that correlation between the socio-demographic factors and the process of oncogenesis requires intensive research. In our work, we have tried to fill this gap for the population of Central and Eastern Europe to determine the exact epidemiology of this kind of cancer. This knowledge may be then used for developing cancer prevention methods specific to gender and age.},

abstract = {Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Incidence rates of melanoma have been increasing, especially among non-Hispanic white males and females, but survival rates are high if detected early. Due to the costs for dermatologists to screen every patient, there is a need for an automated system to assess a patient's risk of melanoma using images of their skin lesions captured using a standard digital camera. One challenge in implementing such a system is locating the skin lesion in the digital image. A novel texture-based skin lesion segmentation algorithm is proposed. A set of representative texture distributions are learned from an illumination-corrected photograph and a texture distinctiveness metric is calculated for each distribution. Next, regions in the image are classified as normal skin or lesion based on the occurrence of representative texture distributions. The proposed segmentation framework is tested by comparing lesion segmentation results and melanoma classification results to results using other state-of-art algorithms. The proposed framework has higher segmentation accuracy compared to all other tested algorithms. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Skin is the largest organ in the body. It covers the body's entire external surface, serving as a first-order barrier against pathogens, UV light, and chemicals, and provides a mechanical barrier to injury. It also regulates temperature and amount of water released into the environment. Skin Thickness: Hairless skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet is thick skin, referring to thickness of epidermis. The thickest skin based on the thickness of the dermis is on the upper portion of the back. But it is considered “thin skin” histologically because of epidermal thickness. Layers of Epidermis: Stratum basale aka stratum germinativum – deepest layer, separated from dermis by basement membrane (basal lamina) and attached by hemidesmosomes. Cells are cuboidal to columnar and are mitotically active stem cells. Stratum spinosum aka prickle cell layer - irregular, polyhedral cells with processes (“spines”) that extend outward and contact neighboring cells by desmosomes. Stratum granulosum - diamond shaped cells which contain keratohyalin granules; aggregates keratin filaments present in cornified cells. Stratum lucidum - if present, thin clear layer consisting of eleidin (transformation product of keratohyalin); usually seen in thick skin only. Stratum corneum - outermost layer, made up of keratin and horny scales which were once living cells; dead cells known as squamous (anucleate); layer which varies most in thickness, especially thick in callused skin. Cells of the Epidermis: Keratinocytes. Melanocytes. Langerhans' cells. Merkel's cell. Keratinocytes: Predominate cell type of epidermis. Originate in basal layer. Produce keratin. Formation of epidermal water barrier. Melanocytes: Derived from neural crest cells. Manufacture melanin. Melanin mainly found in stratum basale and is protective against UV radiation; melanocytes found between cells of stratum basale. Produced by oxidation of tyrosine to 3,4–DOPA by tyrosinase and then there is the transformation of DOPA into melanin. Melanocytes send out long processes extending between epidermal cells, contacting them. Melanin granules from melanocytes are transferred via the long processes to cytoplasm of basal keratinocyte. Melanin transferred to neighboring keratinocytes by “pigment donation”; involves phagocytosis of tips of melanocyte processes by keratinocytes. Langerhans' Cells: Dendritic, antigen-presenting, need special stains to visualize in stratum spinosum (mainly). Mesenchymal origin, derived from stem cells of bone marrow – part of mononuclear-phagocytic system. Birbeck granules. Express MHC I and MHC II molecules. Uptake antigens in skin and transport to lymph node. Merkel Cells: Modified epidermal cells in stratum basale. Sensory function for fine-touch, most populous in fingertips. Bound to adjoining keratinocytes by desmosomes and have intermediate keratin filaments. Dermis It consists of two layers of connective tissue which merge together, no clear demarcation. Papillary layer - Outer layer, thinner, composed of loose connective tissue and contacts epidermis. Reticular layer - Deeper layer, thicker, less cellular, and consists of dense connective tissue/ bundles of collagen fibers. The dermis houses the skin appendages (sweat glands and hairs), many sensory neurons, and blood vessels. Hypodermis Also called subcutaneous fascia, Deepest layer of skin. Contains adipose lobules along with some skin appendages (hair follicles), sensory neurons, and blood vessels.},

The explanations may either be post-hoc or directly come from an explainable model. Explainable recommendation tries to address the problem of why: by providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommendation systems. It also facilitates system designers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches -- especially model-based methods -- have been proposed and applied in real-world systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review for the explainable recommendation research. We highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W, i.e., what, when, who, where, and why. We then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation on three perspectives: 1) We provide a chronological research timeline of explainable recommendation, including user study approaches in the early years and more recent model-based approaches. 2) We provide a two-dimensional taxonomy to classify existing explainable recommendation research: one dimension is the information source of the explanations, and the other dimension is the algorithmic mechanism to generate explainable recommendations. 3) We summarize how explainable recommendation applies to different recommendation tasks, such as product, social, and POI recommendations. We also devote a section to discuss the future directions to promote the explainable recommendation research.},

abstract = {Background GPs need to recognise significant pigmented skin lesions, given rising UK incidence rates for malignant melanoma. The 7-point checklist (7PCL) has been recommended by NICE (2005) for routine use in UK general practice to identify clinically significant lesions which require urgent referral. Aim To validate the Original and Weighted versions of the 7PCL in the primary care setting. Design and setting Diagnostic validation study, using data from a SIAscopic diagnostic aid randomised controlled trial in eastern England. Method Adults presenting in general practice with a pigmented skin lesion that could not be immediately diagnosed as benign were recruited into the trial. Reference standard diagnoses were histology or dermatology expert opinion; 7PCL scores were calculated blinded to the reference diagnosis. A case was defined as a clinically significant lesion for primary care referral to secondary care (total 1436 lesions: 225 cases, 1211 controls); or melanoma (36). Results For diagnosing clinically significant lesions there was a difference between the performance of the Original and Weighted 7PCLs (respectively, area under curve: 0.66, 0.69, difference = 0.03, P{\textless}0.001). For the identification of melanoma, similar differences were found. Increasing the Weighted 7PCL's cut-off score from recommended 3 to 4 improved detection of clinically significant lesions in primary care: sensitivity 73.3{\%}, specificity 57.1{\%}, positive predictive value 24.1{\%}, negative predictive value 92.0{\%}, while maintaining high sensitivity of 91.7{\%} and moderate specificity of 53.4{\%} for melanoma. Conclusion The Original and Weighted 7PCLs both performed well in a primary care setting to identify clinically significant lesions as well as melanoma. The Weighted 7PCL, with a revised cut-off score of 4 from 3, performs slightly better and could be applied in general practice to support the recognition of clinically significant lesions and therefore the early identification of melanoma. {\textcopyright} British Journal of General Practice.},

An appealing approach for early detection is to employ automated classification of dermoscopic images acquired via low-cost, smartphone-based hardware. By far, the most successful classification approaches on this task are based on deep learning. Unfortunately, most medical image classification tasks are unable to leverage the true potential of deep learning due to limited sizes of training datasets. Investigation of novel data generation techniques is thus an appealing option since it can enable us to augment our training data by a large number of synthetically generated examples. In this work, we investigate the possibility of obtaining realistic looking dermoscopic images via generative adversarial networks (GANs). These images are then employed to augment our existing training set in an effort to enhance the performance of a deep convolutional neural network on the skin lesion classification task. Results are compared with conventional data augmentation strategies and demonstrate that GAN based augmentation delivers significant performance gains.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

The purpose of this paper is to present an automatic skin lesions classification system with higher classification rate using the theory of transfer learning and the pre-trained deep neural network. The transfer learning has been applied to the Alex-net in different ways, including fine-tuning the weights of the architecture, replacing the classification layer with a softmax layer that works with two or three kinds of skin lesions, and augmenting dataset by fixed and random rotation angles. The new softmax layer has the ability to classify the segmented color image lesions into melanoma and nevus or into melanoma, seborrheic keratosis, and nevus. The three well-known datasets, MED-NODE, Derm (IS {\&} Quest) and ISIC, are used in testing and verifying the proposed method. The proposed DCNN weights have been fine-tuned using the training and testing dataset from ISIC in addition to 10-fold cross validation for MED-NODE and DermIS—DermQuest.

In this study, a novel Gabor wavelet-based deep convolutional neural network is proposed for the detection of malignant melanoma and seborrheic keratosis. The proposed method is based on the decomposition of input images into seven directional sub-bands. Seven sub-band images and the input image are used as inputs to eight parallel CNNs to generate eight probabilistic predictions. Decision fusion based on the sum rule is utilized to classify the skin lesion. Gabor based approach provides directional decomposition where each sub-band gives isolated decisions that can be fused for improved overall performance.

Image segmentation is an important step towards building computerized detection and classification systems by delineating the area of interest, in our case, the skin lesion, from the background. However, current segmentation techniques are hard pressed to account for color artifacts within dermoscopic images that are often incorrectly detected as part of the lesion. Often there are few annotated examples of these artifacts, which limits training segmentation methods like the fully convolutional network (FCN) due to the skewed dataset. We propose to improve FCN training by augmenting the dataset with synthetic images created in a controlled manner using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Our novelty lies in the use of a color label (CL) to specify the different characteristics (approximate size, location, and shape) of the different regions (skin, lesion, artifacts) in the synthetic images. Our GAN is trained to perform style transfer of real melanoma image characteristics (e.g. texture) onto these color labels, allowing us to generate specific types of images containing artifacts. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic images generated by our technique have a lower mean average error when compared to synthetic images generated using traditional binary labels. As a consequence, we demonstrated improvements in melanoma image segmentation when using synthetic images generated by our technique.},

The tumor affects mainly photoexposed areas, most often in the head and seldom appears on genitalia and perigenital region. BCC progresses slowly and metastases are found in less than 0.5{\%} of the cases; however, a considerable local destruction and mutilation could be observed when treatment is neglected or inadequate. Different variants as nodular, cystic, micronodular, superficial, pigment BCC are described in literature and the differential diagnosis in some cases could be difficult. The staging of BCC is made according to Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification and is essential for performing the adequate treatment. Numerous therapeutic methods established for treatment of BCC, having their advantages or disadvantages, do not absolutely dissolve the risk of relapses. The early diagnostics based on the good knowledge and timely organized and adequate treatment is a precondition for better prognosis. Despite the slow progress and numerous therapeutic methods, the basal cell carcinoma should not be underestimated.},

abstract = {Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and is on rise. There exists a research trend for computerized analysis of suspicious skin lesions for malignancy using images captured by digital cameras. Analysis of these images is usually challenging due to existence of disturbing factors such as illumination variations and light reflections from skin surface. One important stage in diagnosis of melanoma is segmentation of lesion region from normal skin. In this paper, a method for accurate extraction of lesion region is proposed that is based on deep learning approaches. The input image, after being preprocessed to reduce noisy artifacts, is applied to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN combines local and global contextual information and outputs a label for each pixel, producing a segmentation mask that shows the lesion region. This mask will be further refined by some post processing operations. The experimental results show that our proposed method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of segmentation accuracy.},

However, exactly what kinds of explanation are truly human-interpretable remains poorly understood. This work advances our understanding of what makes explanations interpretable under three specific tasks that users may perform with machine learning systems: simulation of the response, verification of a suggested response, and determining whether the correctness of a suggested response changes under a change to the inputs. Through carefully controlled human-subject experiments, we identify regularizers that can be used to optimize for the interpretability of machine learning systems. Our results show that the type of complexity matters: cognitive chunks (newly defined concepts) affect performance more than variable repetitions, and these trends are consistent across tasks and domains. This suggests that there may exist some common design principles for explanation systems.},

However,due to the requirements for long acquisition and breath-hold,the clinical routine is still dominated by multi-slice 2D imaging,which hamper the visualization of anatomy and quantitative measurements as relatively thick slices are acquired. As a solution,we propose a novel image super-resolution (SR) approach that is based on a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) model. It reconstructs high resolution 3D volumes from 2D image stacks for more accurate image analysis. The proposed model allows the use of multiple input data acquired from different viewing planes for improved performance. Experimental results on 1233 cardiac short and long-axis MR image stacks show that the CNN model outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods in terms of image quality while being computationally efficient. Also,we show that image segmentation and motion tracking benefits more from SR-CNN when it is used as an initial upscaling method than conventional interpolation methods for the subsequent analysis.},

abstract = {The initial assessment of skin lesions is typically based on dermoscopic images. As this is a difficult and time-consuming task, machine learning methods using dermoscopic images have been proposed to assist human experts. Other approaches have studied electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as a basis for clinical decision support systems. Both methods represent different ways of measuring skin lesion properties as dermoscopy relies on visible light and EIS uses electric currents. Thus, the two methods might carry complementary features for lesion classification. Therefore, we propose joint deep learning models considering both EIS and dermoscopy for melanoma detection. For this purpose, we first study machine learning methods for EIS that incorporate domain knowledge and previously used heuristics into the design process. As a result, we propose a recurrent model with state-max-pooling which automatically learns the relevance of different EIS measurements. Second, we combine this new model with different convolutional neural networks that process dermoscopic images. We study ensembling approaches and also propose a cross-attention module guiding information exchange between the EIS and dermoscopy model. In general, combinations of EIS and dermoscopy clearly outperform models that only use either EIS or dermoscopy. We show that our attention-based, combined model outperforms other models with specificities of 34.4{\%} (CI 31.3-38.4), 34.7{\%} (CI 31.0-38.8) and 53.7{\%} (CI 50.1-57.6) for dermoscopy, EIS and the combined model, respectively, at a clinically relevant sensitivity of 98{\%}.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between com- puter and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the- art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99{\%} confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neu- ral networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possi- ble to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call “fooling images” (more generally, fooling ex- amples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise ques- tions about the generality of DNN computer vision},

abstract = {Dermatoscopy, also known as dermoscopy or epiluminescence microscopy (ELM), is a non-invasive, in vivo technique, which permits visualization of features of pigmented melanocytic neoplasms that are not discernable by examination with the naked eye. ELM offers a completely new range of visual features. One such prominent feature is the pigment network. Two texture-based algorithms are developed for the detection of pigment network. These methods are applicable to various texture patterns in dermatoscopy images, including patterns that lack fine lines such as cobblestone, follicular, or thickened network patterns. Two texture algorithms, Laws energy masks and the neighborhood gray-level dependence matrix (NGLDM) large number emphasis, were optimized on a set of 155 dermatoscopy images and compared. Results suggest superiority of Laws energy masks for pigment network detection in dermatoscopy images. For both methods, a texel width of 10 pixels or approximately 0.22 mm is found for dermatoscopy images. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This issue impedes the application of AI technology to such business areas as finance and medicine, which demand absolute reliability. To address this issue, we have developed an AI technology that combines Deep Tensor, Fujitsu's original machine-learning technology based on enhanced deep learning, and another Fujitsu-developed machine-learning technology based on knowledge graph, a knowledge base represented by graph data taken from past documents and databases. This has enabled us to logically explain the reasons and bases in which Deep Tensor reaches its inference output.

Several surveys have been written in the past decade, but these tend to cover all of the steps of a CAD system, which can be overwhelming.

abstract = {Objective: To estimate the prevalence of melanoma clinically mimicking seborrheic keratosis. Design: Retrospective review of cases submitted for histological examination with a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis or with a differential diagnosis that included seborrheic keratosis. Setting: A tertiary medical care center-based dermatopathology laboratory serving academic dermatology clinics that have a busy pigmented lesion clinic. Materials and Methods: A total of 9204 consecutive pathology reports containing a diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis in the clinical information field were identified between the years 1992 and 2001 through a computer database search. Reports with a final histological diagnosis of melanoma were selected for further review and clinicopathological analysis. Main Outcome Measure: Histological diagnosis, which was correlated with the preoperative clinical diagnosis. Results: Melanoma was identified in 61 cases (0.66{\%}) submitted for histological examination with a clinical diagnosis that included seborrheic keratosis. Melanoma was in the clinical differential diagnosis of 31 cases (51{\%}). The remaining lesions had a differential diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis vs melanocytic nevus (17 cases, 28{\%}), basal cell carcinoma (7 cases, 12{\%}), or a squamous proliferation (3 cases, 5{\%}). In 3 cases (5{\%}), seborrheic keratosis was the only clinical diagnosis. All histological types of melanoma were represented. Conclusions: Our results confirm that melanoma can mimic seborrheic keratosis. These data strongly support the current policy of submitting for histological examination all specimens that have been removed from patients.},

abstract = {Background: Amelanotic malignant melanoma is a subtype of cutaneous melanoma with little or no pigment on visual inspection. It may mimic benign and malignant variants of both melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions. Objectives: To evaluate whether dermoscopy is also a useful technique for the diagnosis of amelanotic/hypomelanotic melanoma (AHM). Methods: We conducted a retrospective clinical study of 151 amelanotic/hypomelanotic skin lesions from 151 patients with a mean age of 47 years (± 17.5 SD). Digitized images of amelanotic/hypomelanotic skin lesions were converted to JPEG format and sent by e-mail from the five participating centres. Lesions included 55 amelanotic/hypomelanotic nonmelanocytic lesions (AHNML), 52 amelanotic/ hypomelanotic benign melanocytic lesions (AHBML), and 44 AHM, 10 (23{\%}) of which were nonpigmented, truly amelanotic melanomas (AM). The 44 AHM lesions were divided into thin melanomas (TnM) ≤ 1 mm (29 cases) and thick melanomas (TkM) {\textgreater} 1 mm (15 cases), according to the Breslow index. Five clinical features (elevation, ulceration, shape, borders and colour) as well as 10 dermoscopic criteria (pigment network, pigmentation, streaks, dots/globules, blue-whitish veil, regression structures, hypopigmentation, leaf-like areas, multiple grey-bluish globules, central white patch) and eight vascular patterns (comma, arborizing, hairpin, dotted, linear irregular, dotted and linear irregular vessels, and milky-red areas) were evaluated in order to achieve clinical and dermoscopic diagnoses. Statistical analyses were performed with the $\chi$2-test and Fisher's exact test, when appropriate. Results: The most frequent and significant clinical features for TnM and TkM were asymmetry and ulceration (the latter only for TkM) compared with AHBML. Irregular dots/globules (62{\%} vs. 35{\%}; P ≤ 0.03), regression structures (48{\%} vs. 27{\%}; P ≤ 0.03), irregular pigmentation (41{\%} vs. 11{\%}; P ≤ 0.03) and blue-whitish veil (10{\%} vs. 0{\%}; P ≤ 0.03) were the most relevant dermoscopic criteria for TnM in comparison with AHBML. TkM differed significantly from AHBML in frequency of occurrence of irregular pigmentation (87{\%} vs. 11{\%}; P ≤ 0.03), irregular dots/globules (73{\%} vs. 35{\%}; P ≤ 0.03), regression structures (67{\%} vs. 27{\%}; P ≤ 0.03), blue-whitish veil (27{\%} vs. 0{\%}; P ≤ 0.03) and hypopigmentation (13{\%} vs. 55{\%}; P ≤ 0.03). Linear irregular vessels and the combination of dotted and linear irregular vessels associated with TnM and TkM were not found in our cases of AHBML and were only rarely seen in AHNML (3.6{\%} and 1.8{\%}, respectively). Moreover, TkM differed significantly from AHBML and TnM in frequency of occurrence of milky-red areas (93{\%} vs. 17{\%}; P ≤ 0.03 and 93{\%} vs. 31{\%}; P ≤ 0.01, respectively). The dermoscopic diagnosis of melanoma had a higher sensitivity and specificity than the clinical diagnosis (89{\%} and 96{\%} vs. 65{\%} and 88{\%}, respectively). With the limitation of the small number of cases, vascular patterns were the only dermoscopic criteria for 'truly' AM. In the 10 cases of 'truly' AM, we found milky-red areas in more than half of the cases (six of 10), dotted vessels in four, hairpin vessels in two, linear irregular vessels in two, dotted and linear irregular vessels in two. Conclusions: Because dermoscopy uses criteria reflecting pigmentation (irregular pigmentation and irregular dots/globules) and vascular patterns, it is a useful technique not only for pigmented melanoma but also for hypomelanotic melanoma. In 'truly' AM, vascular patterns alone may not be sufficient to diagnose melanoma. A combined approach with the clinical information should help in the detection of 'truly' AM.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether diagnosis and diagnostic confidence changes when viewing dermoscopic images from NPDs and PDs. METHODS: A total of 100 dermatologists participated in the study. Twenty-five pigmented lesions were shown in the study, consisting of 7 seborrheic keratoses (SK), 3 basal cell carcinomas, 2 atypical nevi, 5 malignant melanomas (MM), 3 dermatofibromas, 3 blue nevi, and 2 hemangiomas. Two images of each lesion (one NPD and one PD) were included. The McNemar test and paired t-test were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Ninety-one participants completed the study. Significant differences in the diagnoses were observed for the SK, atypical nevus, and MM images. Seventy-five percent and 59{\%} of the final participants correctly diagnosed SK when presented with the NPD and PD images, respectively. For MM, 23 and 34{\%} made the correct diagnoses with the NPD and PD images, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Viewing lesions with NPD versus PD can affect the diagnosis and diagnostic confidence of physicians that are novices with dermoscopy.

In order to face the challenge arise from morphological diversity in histopathological slides, we built a multicenter database of 2241 digital whole-slide images from 1321 patients from 2008 to 2018.

The CNNs achieves superior performance across both tasks, demonstrating an AI capable of classifying skin cancer in the analysis from histopathological images. For making the classifications reasonable, the visualization of CNN representations is furthermore used to identify cells between melanoma and nevi. Regions of interest (ROI) are also located which are significantly helpful, giving pathologists more support of correctly diagnosis.},

abstract = {Background: Dermoscopy is a noninvasive technique that enables the clinician to perform direct microscopic examination of diagnostic features, not seen by the naked eye, in pigmented skin lesions. Diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy has previously been assessed in meta-analyses including studies performed in experimental and clinical settings. Objectives: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy for the diagnosis of melanoma compared with naked eye examination by performing a meta-analysis exclusively on studies performed in a clinical setting. Methods: We searched for publications from 1987 to January 2008 and found nine eligible studies. The selected studies compare diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopy with naked eye examination using a valid reference test on consecutive patients with a defined clinical presentation, performed in a clinical setting. Hierarchical summary receiver operator curve analysis was used to estimate the relative diagnostic accuracy for clinical examination with, and without, the use of dermoscopy. Results: We found the relative diagnostic odds ratio for melanoma, for dermoscopy compared with naked eye examination, to be 15.6 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 2.9-83.7, P = 0.016]; removal of two outlier studies changed this to 9.0 (95{\%} CI 1.5-54.6, P = 0.03).

abstract = {The segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopic images is a fundamental step in automated computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Conventional segmentation methods, however, have difficulties when the lesion borders are indistinct and when contrast between the lesion and the surrounding skin is low. They also perform poorly when there is a heterogeneous background or a lesion that touches the image boundaries; this then results in under- and oversegmentation of the skin lesion. We suggest that saliency detection using the reconstruction errors derived from a sparse representation model coupled with a novel background detection can more accurately discriminate the lesion from surrounding regions. We further propose a Bayesian framework that better delineates the shape and boundaries of the lesion. We also evaluated our approach on two public datasets comprising 1100 dermoscopic images and compared it to other conventional and state-of-the-art unsupervised (i.e., no training required) lesion segmentation methods, as well as the state-of-the-art unsupervised saliency detection methods. Our results show that our approach is more accurate and robust in segmenting lesions compared to other methods. We also discuss the general extension of our framework as a saliency optimization algorithm for lesion segmentation.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is detected in skin lesions. The most common skin cancer is melanoma. Skin cancer is increasing in several parts of the world. Due to the above, it is important to work on the classification of melanomas, in order to support the possible detection of malignant melanomas that cause skin cancer. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification of melanomas. We use images available from International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). We created a repository of 1000 images and did training with a sequential CNN to obtain two categories: benign and malignant melanomas. In the first instance we obtained results of 94.89{\%} accuracy and 82.25{\%} in validation. In the second instance we created another repository of 600 images for the method that we propose that consists in adding metadata within the same pixel matrix of the image in each RGB layer. The image was shown with a band of colors at the bottom. We made training with the CNN using images with metadata and achieved the results: 98.39{\%} of accuracy and 79{\%} of validation. Therefore, we conclude that adding the metadata repeatedly to the pixel matrix of the image improves the results of the classification.},

abstract = {Importance: The comparative diagnostic performance of dermoscopic algorithms and their individual criteria are not well studied. Objectives: To analyze the discriminatory power and reliability of dermoscopic criteria used in melanoma detection and compare the diagnostic accuracy of existing algorithms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a retrospective, observational study of 477 lesions (119 melanomas [24.9{\%}] and 358 nevi [75.1{\%}]), which were divided into 12 image sets that consisted of 39 or 40 images per set. A link on the International Dermoscopy Society website from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, directed participants to the study website. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2013, through May 31, 2015. Participants included physicians, residents, and medical students, and there were no specialty-type or experience-level restrictions. Participants were randomly assigned to evaluate 1 of the 12 image sets. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations with melanoma and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were evaluated for the presence of dermoscopic criteria. Diagnostic accuracy measures were estimated for the following algorithms: the ABCD rule, the Menzies method, the 7-point checklist, the 3-point checklist, chaos and clues, and CASH (color, architecture, symmetry, and homogeneity). Results: A total of 240 participants registered, and 103 (42.9{\%}) evaluated all images. The 110 participants (45.8{\%}) who evaluated fewer than 20 lesions were excluded, resulting in data from 130 participants (54.2{\%}), 121 (93.1{\%}) of whom were regular dermoscopy users. Criteria associated with melanoma included marked architectural disorder (odds ratio [OR], 6.6; 95{\%} CI, 5.6-7.8), pattern asymmetry (OR, 4.9; 95{\%} CI, 4.1-5.8), nonorganized pattern (OR, 3.3; 95{\%} CI, 2.9-3.7), border score of 6 (OR, 3.3; 95{\%} CI, 2.5-4.3), and contour asymmetry (OR, 3.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.7-3.7) (P {\textless} .001 for all). Most dermoscopic criteria had poor to fair interobserver agreement. Criteria that reached moderate levels of agreement included comma vessels (ICC, 0.44; 95{\%} CI, 0.40-0.49), absence of vessels (ICC, 0.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.42-0.51), dark brown color (ICC, 0.40; 95{\%} CI, 0.35-0.44), and architectural disorder (ICC, 0.43; 95{\%} CI, 0.39-0.48). The Menzies method had the highest sensitivity for melanoma diagnosis (95.1{\%}) but the lowest specificity (24.8{\%}) compared with any other method (P {\textless} .001). The ABCD rule had the highest specificity (59.4{\%}). All methods had similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Conclusions and Relevance: Important dermoscopic criteria for melanoma recognition were revalidated by participants with varied experience. Six algorithms tested had similar but modest levels of diagnostic accuracy, and the interobserver agreement of most individual criteria was poor.},

abstract = {Developing automatic diagnostic tools for the early detection of skin cancer lesions in dermoscopic images can help to reduce melanoma-induced mortality. Image segmentation is a key step in the automated skin lesion diagnosis pipeline. In this paper, a fast and fully-automatic algorithm for skin lesion segmentation in dermoscopic images is presented. Delaunay Triangulation is used to extract a binary mask of the lesion region, without the need of any training stage. A quantitative experimental evaluation has been conducted on a publicly available database, by taking into account six well-known state-of-the-art segmentation methods for comparison. The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly accurate when dealing with benign lesions, while the segmentation accuracy significantly decreases when melanoma images are processed. This behavior led us to consider geometrical and color features extracted from the binary masks generated by our algorithm for classification, achieving promising results for melanoma detection.},

abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i)give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii)indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii)provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

Although deep learning based approaches have significantly improved the segmentation accuracy, these algorithms are still reliant on having a large enough dataset in order to achieve adequate results. Inspired by the immense success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose a GAN-based augmentation of the original dataset in order to improve the segmentation performance. In particular, we use the segmentation masks available in the training dataset to train the Mask2Lesion model, and use the model to generate new lesion images given any arbitrary mask, which are then used to augment the original training dataset. We test Mask2Lesion augmentation on the ISBI ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset and achieve an improvement of 5.17{\%} in the mean Dice score as compared to a model trained with only classical data augmentation techniques.},

@article{Ribeiro2016,
abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {The interest in image dermoscopy has been significantly increased recently and skin lesion images are nowadays routinely acquired for a number of skin disorders. An important finding in the assessment of a skin lesion severity is the existence of dark dots and globules, which are hard to locate and count using existing image software tools. In this work we present a novel methodology for detecting/segmenting and count dark dots and globules from dermoscopy images. Segmentation is performed using a multi-resolution approach based on inverse non-linear diffusion. Subsequently, a number of features are extracted from the segmented dots/globules and their diagnostic value in automatic classification of dermoscopy images of skin lesions into melanoma and non-malignant nevus is evaluated. The proposed algorithm is applied to a number of images with skin lesions with known histo-pathology. Results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in automatically segmenting dark dots and globules. Furthermore, it was found that the features extracted from the segmented dots/globules can enhance the performance of classification algorithms that discriminate between malignant and benign skin lesions, when they are combined with other region-based descriptors.},

abstract = {Although image-based melanoma diagnosis has achieved a sufficient level of numerical accuracy, providing objective evidence is essential to enhance the explainability and reliability of this approach. The collection of label information based on quantitative clinical indicators is very expensive, meaning that the amount of labeled data available is limited. In this paper, we propose an effective method for predicting explainable melanoma indicators defined by a 7-point checklist in a situation where only a limited number of labeled data are available. Our proposal effectively utilizes virtual adversarial training as a semi-supervised learning framework with multi-task learning. This approach gives favorable performance for only a very limited number of expensive labeled data. The proposed method improves the final accuracy of melanoma diagnosis calculated based on these predicted indices by 7.5{\%} (making it equivalent to expert dermatologists), based on 9,124 unlabeled images with diagnosis information added to the 226 base labeled training images.},

@article{Kelly2019,
abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

abstract = {Background: In recent studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperformed dermatologists in distinguishing dermoscopic images of melanoma and nevi. In these studies, dermatologists and artificial intelligence were considered as opponents. However, the combination of classifiers frequently yields superior results, both in machine learning and among humans. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of combining human and artificial intelligence for skin cancer classification. Methods: Using 11,444 dermoscopic images, which were divided into five diagnostic categories, novel deep learning techniques were used to train a single CNN. Then, both 112 dermatologists of 13 German university hospitals and the trained CNN independently classified a set of 300 biopsy-verified skin lesions into those five classes. Taking into account the certainty of the decisions, the two independently determined diagnoses were combined to a new classifier with the help of a gradient boosting method. The primary end-point of the study was the correct classification of the images into five designated categories, whereas the secondary end-point was the correct classification of lesions as either benign or malignant (binary classification). Findings: Regarding the multiclass task, the combination of man and machine achieved an accuracy of 82.95{\%}. This was 1.36{\%} higher than the best of the two individual classifiers (81.59{\%} achieved by the CNN). Owing to the class imbalance in the binary problem, sensitivity, but not accuracy, was examined and demonstrated to be superior (89{\%}) to the best individual classifier (CNN with 86.1{\%}). The specificity in the combined classifier decreased from 89.2{\%} to 84{\%}. However, at an equal sensitivity of 89{\%}, the CNN achieved a specificity of only 81.5{\%} Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the combination of human and artificial intelligence achieves superior results over the independent results of both of these systems.},

abstract = {In this work, a statistical stability metric and novel hybrid statistical-machine learning ammonia forecasting model are developed to improve the accuracy and precision of municipal wastewater treatment. Aeration for biological nutrient removal is typically the largest energy expense for municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Ammonia-based aeration control (ABAC) is one approach designed to minimize excessive aeration by adjusting air blower output from online ammonia measurements rather than from a dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor, which is the conventional aeration control approach. We propose a quantitative stability metric, Total Sample Variance, to compare system-wide variability of competing aeration control strategies. Using this metric, the performance of traditional DO and ABAC control strategies with varying setpoints and control parameters were compared in a medium-sized WWTP, and the most stable strategy was identified and implemented at the facility. To further improve ABAC performance, ammonia forecasting models were constructed using both statistical and machine learning to improve the accuracy of the aeration control system. Diurnal, diurnal-linear, artificial neural network (ANN), and hybrid diurnal-linear-ANN forecasting models were trained on real-time plant-wide process data. The diurnal-linear and diurnal-linear-ANN forecasts were found to most accurately forecast ammonia; improving upon the existing ammonia measurement by up to 32{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively, whereas the ANN model forecast was only able to improve by up to 8{\%}. This work demonstrates the ease and flexibility of integrating statistics and machine learning methods for developing new treatment models in conventional WWTP for features in full-scale conventional activated sludge systems.},

abstract = {Automated melanoma recognition using image processing technique from the available dermoscopic images in deep learning is difficult task because of the contrast and variation of melanoma in skin. It is mainly a non-invasive method so that it cannot contact with skin more forcefully. To overcome these disadvantages this research work proposes a method using very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For more accurate classification in this method we are using FCRN and CNN with the effective training limited data. Initially, Performance of Segmentation is done using residual networks using a image from the dataset followed by Classification by neural networks to check the abnormalities in skin. In this kind of classification technique the network has more specified features from the segmented portion alone. The proposed technique is mainly evaluated on datasets and experimental results that would show the performance in histogram and PSNR ratio.},

abstract = {Transfer learning aims at improving the performance of target learners on target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related source domains. In this way, the dependence on a large number of target domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. As the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning researches, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Different from previous surveys, this survey paper reviews over forty representative transfer learning approaches from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, twenty representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different datasets, i.e., Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31. And the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

abstract = {Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the world and the incidents of skin cancer have been rising over the past decade. Even with a dermoscopic imaging system, which magnifies the lesion region, detecting and classifying skin lesions by visual examination is laborious due to the complex structures of the lesions. This necessitates the need for an automated skin lesion diagnosis system to enhance the diagnostic capability of dermatologists. In this study, the authors propose an automatic skin lesion segmentation method which can be used as a preliminary step for lesion classification. The proposed method comprises two major steps, namely preprocessing and segmentation. In the preprocessing step, noise such as illumination, hair and rulers are removed using filtering techniques and in the segmentation phase, skin lesions are segmented using the GrabCut segmentation algorithm. The k-means clustering algorithm is then used along with the colour features learnt from the training images to improve the boundaries of the segments. To evaluate the authors' proposed method, they have used ISIC 2017 challenge dataset and PH2 dataset. They have obtained Dice coefficient values of 0.8236 and 0.9139 for ISIC 2017 test dataset and PH2 dataset, respectively.},

To accurately extract lesion borders from dermoscopy images, a novel automatic segmentation algorithm using saliency combined with Otsu threshold is proposed in this paper, which includes enhancement and segmentation stages. In the enhancement stage, prior information on healthy skin is extracted, and the color saliency map and brightness saliency map are constructed respectively. By fusing the two saliency maps, the final enhanced image is obtained. In the segmentation stage, according to the histogram distribution of the enhanced image, an optimization function is designed to adjust the traditional Otsu threshold method to obtain more accurate lesion borders. The proposed model is validated from enhancement effectiveness and segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is robust and performs better than other state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite the fact that dermoscopy is a very specialized technique, in some practical situations, patients do not have a fast access to an specialist. In this situations, pre-screening systems can be used to evaluate a suspect skin lesion by a non-specialist, and lesion segmentation is very important for the success of such systems. This paper proposes a new method for segmenting pigmented skin lesions on macroscopic images acquired with standard cameras. Our method is simpler than comparable methods proposed for dermoscopy, and our experiments based on publicly available datasets of pigmented skin lesion images show promising results.

abstract = {Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. These systems's adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research field on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this field.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective.

In this paper, we present algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees to mine these data sets and select prototypes, a.k.a. representatives that optimally describes them. Our work notably generalizes the recent work by Kim et al. (2016) where in addition to selecting prototypes, we also associate non-negative weights which are indicative of their importance. This extension provides a single coherent framework under which both prototypes and criticisms (i.e. outliers) can be found. Furthermore, our framework works for any symmetric positive definite kernel thus addressing one of the key open questions laid out in Kim et al. (2016). By establishing that our objective function enjoys a key property of that of weak submodularity, we present a fast ProtoDash algorithm and also derive approximation guarantees for the same. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on diverse domains such as retail, digit recognition (MNIST) and on publicly available 40 health questionnaires obtained from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) website maintained by the US Dept. of Health. We validate the results quantitatively as well as qualitatively based on expert feedback and recently published scientific studies on public health, thus showcasing the power of our technique in providing actionability (for retail), utility (for MNIST), and insight (on CDC datasets), which arguably are the hallmarks of an effective interpretable machine learning method.},

abstract = {Early detection of melanoma by magnified visible-light imaging (dermoscopy) is hindered by lesions which mimic melanoma. Automatic discrimination of melanoma from mimics could allow detection of melanoma at an earlier stage. Seborrheic keratoses are common mimics; these have distinctive bright structures: starry milia-like cysts (MLCs). We report discrimination of MLCs from mimics by features extracted from starry MLC (star) candidates. After pre-processing, 2D template matching is optimized with respect to star template size, histogram pre-processing, and 2D statistics. The novel aspects of this research were new details for region of interest (ROI) analysis of the centers of the star candidate, a new method for determining shape of hazy objects and multiple template matching, using unprocessed ROIs, shape-limited ROIs, and histogram-equalized ROIs. Features retained in the final model for the decision MLC vs. mimic by logistic regression include star size, 2D first correlation coefficient, correlation coefficient to the star shape template, equalized correlation coefficient, relative star brightness, and statistical features at the star center. These methods allow optimization of MLC features found by 2D template correlation. This research confirms the importance of fine ROI features and ROI neighborhoods in medical imaging.},

Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.},

abstract = {Objective Most skin lesions first present in primary care, where distinguishing rare melanomas from benign lesions can be challenging. Dermoscopy improves diagnostic accuracy among specialists and is promoted for use by primary care physicians (PCPs). However, when used by untrained clinicians, accuracy may be no better than visual inspection. This study aimed to undertake a systematic review of literature reporting use of dermoscopy to triage suspicious skin lesions in primary care settings, and challenges for implementation. Design A systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and SCOPUS bibliographic databases from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2017, without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria Studies including assessment of dermoscopy accuracy, acceptability to patients and PCPs, training requirements, and cost-effectiveness of dermoscopy modes in primary care, including trials, diagnostic accuracy and acceptability studies. Results 23 studies met the review criteria, representing 49 769 lesions and 3708 PCPs, all from high-income countries. There was a paucity of studies set truly in primary care and the outcomes measured were diverse. The heterogeneity therefore made meta-analysis unfeasible; the data were synthesised through narrative review. Dermoscopy, with appropriate training, was associated with improved diagnostic accuracy for melanoma and benign lesions, and reduced unnecessary excisions and referrals. Teledermoscopy-based referral systems improved triage accuracy. Only three studies examined cost-effectiveness; hence, there was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions. Costs, training and time requirements were considered important implementation barriers. Patient satisfaction was seldom assessed. Computer-aided dermoscopy and other technological advances have not yet been tested in primary care. Conclusions Dermoscopy could help PCPs triage suspicious lesions for biopsy, urgent referral or reassurance. However, it will be important to establish further evidence on minimum training requirements to reach competence, as well as the cost-effectiveness and patient acceptability of implementing dermoscopy in primary care.

Among many of DNN structures, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are currently the main tool used for the image analysis and classification purposes. Although great achievements and perspectives, deep neural networks and accompanying learning algorithms have some relevant challenges to tackle. In this paper, we have focused on the most frequently mentioned problem in the field of machine learning, that is the lack of sufficient amount of the training data or uneven class balance within the datasets. One of the ways of dealing with this problem is so called data augmentation. In the paper we have compared and analyzed multiple methods of data augmentation in the task of image classification, starting from classical image transformations like rotating, cropping, zooming, histogram based methods and finishing at Style Transfer and Generative Adversarial Networks, along with the representative examples. Next, we presented our own method of data augmentation based on image style transfer. The method allows to generate the new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of a base image with the appearance of another ones. The newly created images can be used to pre-train the given neural network in order to improve the training process efficiency. Proposed method is validated on the three medical case studies: skin melanomas diagnosis, histopathological images and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans analysis, utilizing the image classification in order to provide a diagnose. In such kind of problems the data deficiency is one of the most relevant issues. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods being analyzed.},

Conditioned image generation or the synthesis of super-resolution images are some of their main uses, but they are also helpful when tackling particular image classification and segmentation problems.

abstract = {Melanoma mortality rates are the highest amongst skin cancer patients. Melanoma is life threating when it grows beyond the dermis of the skin. Hence, depth is an important factor to diagnose melanoma. This paper introduces a non-invasive computerized dermoscopy system that considers the estimated depth of skin lesions for diagnosis. A 3-D skin lesion reconstruction technique using the estimated depth obtained from regular dermoscopic images is presented. On basis of the 3-D reconstruction, depth and 3-D shape features are extracted. In addition to 3-D features, regular color, texture, and 2-D shape features are also extracted. Feature extraction is critical to achieve accurate results. Apart from melanoma, in-situ melanoma the proposed system is designed to diagnose basal cell carcinoma, blue nevus, dermatofibroma, haemangioma, seborrhoeic keratosis, and normal mole lesions. For experimental evaluations, the PH2, ISIC: Melanoma Project, and ATLAS dermoscopy data sets is considered. Different feature set combinations is considered and performance is evaluated. Significant performance improvement is reported the post inclusion of estimated depth and 3-D features. The good classification scores of sensitivity = 96{\%}, specificity = 97{\%} on PH2 data set and sensitivity = 98{\%}, specificity = 99{\%} on the ATLAS data set is achieved. Experiments conducted to estimate tumor depth from 3-D lesion reconstruction is presented. Experimental results achieved prove that the proposed computerized dermoscopy system is efficient and can be used to diagnose varied skin lesion dermoscopy images.},
